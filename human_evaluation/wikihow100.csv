Keep related supplies in the same area.,
Make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session.,
Place loose supplies in large, clearly visible containers.,
Use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches, photos, and reference material.,
Use every inch of the room for storage, especially vertical space.,
Use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls.,
Purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi-permanent.,
Make a habit of throwing out old, excess, or useless stuff each month.",How to Be an Organized Artist1," If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio. Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:


Essential supplies area -- the things you use every day.
Inspiration and reference area.
Dedicated work area .
Infrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;
, This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.


Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.

, As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:


Canvas shoe racks on the back of the door
Wine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.
Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.

, A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.


Don't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.

Be inspired and it will help you succeed!",How to Create a Neopoprealist Art Work," See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step. However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.


Use the lines to create the image shape and sections.
Fill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.
Add text if needed, for example ""NeoPopRealism is 25!""
Add a colored strip on the top, any color you wish.;
, Painting a mural always requires some preparation. You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.

This surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.

, For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.

Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.
Paints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.

, See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements., Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color., If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold., Mark the horizontal and vertical lines., Use white paint as background., Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand., Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing., An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns., If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location. Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred., If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer., However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling. But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books. Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.

Pay close attention to movies, television shows, and video games.,
Develop a specialization.",How to Be a Visual Effects Artist1," It is possible to become a VFX artist without a college degree, but the path is often easier with one. VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation. Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates. The availability of internships is another factor to consider.Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants.;
, Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree. Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from., Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs. Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.

, Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations. Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own. Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used., Take as many art and design classes as you can. Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills. As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing. Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you. Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves? Or, in what situations do shadows appear?

, Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail. Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see. Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting. Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like., As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design. This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work. To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.

Study how art is properly stored.,
Have your art investments appraised occasionally.,
Consider renting out your art investments.,
Understand that selling an art investment can take time.",How to Become an Art Investor," The best art investors do their research on the pieces of art that they buy, so someone with some education or interest in the art world is more likely to understand this niche market. As well as personal research, you will need to have contacts with people in the art world, such as auctioneers, gallery directors and dealers, who can give you good investment advice.;
, You may confuse these three terms, if you are not careful. Each of them has a slightly different goal in mind when looking to buy art.


Art collectors do not buy art for investment purposes. They buy it to decorate and display in their home. Because they consider them to be an important part of their home or life, most art collectors have a hard time parting with pieces of their collection. While many collectors do end up selling some pieces of art, it may be done because of necessity. Collectors often loan their works out to museums and occasionally donate them to museums upon their death.
Art investors seek to diversify their portfolio with an art investment. Some investment firms put about two and a half to three percent of their investment money in art. They seek good advice and often buy paintings that are older and have been popular historically, such as paintings by the Old Masters. These investments are kept over decades, and sold off when the market is right, with the investor seeking to get a six to ten percent profit rise per year. These investments are also often made to be given as inheritance to future generations of the family. Art investment is often undertaken by the very wealthy.
Art speculators try to invest in art that they believe will appreciate in value. They aim to buy art at a low price from budding artists in the beginning of their careers. Then they hope to sell their work in 10 to 15 years when the artists are at the peak of their careers and people or collectors are willing to pay much more for their pieces. This is a type of investment that takes intimate involvement with the art world and liquidity in order to buy the art.

, Art investments should be no more than a small part of your investment portfolio, along with stocks, bonds, new businesses and more. Figure out what your range is before you begin to pick out potential pieces, and get advice from investors and art dealers.

, Study the Mei Moses Fine Art Index to get a firm grasp of the art market today. Although they cannot predict what will be popular in the future, they can tell you what art tends to keep its value and be a low-risk and what art has a more volatile market value.

, While this is not an absolute rule to follow, paintings from successful artists tend to get better returns than sculpture and installation art.

, Get all the information you can out of them before making a purchase. If you are going to buy at auction, be prepared to walk away if the price goes higher than your investment range.


Beware of art auctioneers or dealers that promise too high a return on paintings. In many ways, they are just like stock brokers and other financial investment firms, who may promise anything to get a sale. They should be found trustworthy before you buy anything, because ponzi schemes and art market bubbles are part of this investment landscape as well.
If you have never bought art in an auction environment before, you may want to seek advice about how it is done properly. You should study the auction booklet before hand, learn about secret buyers and how prices can quickly inflate. Most fine auction houses would be willing to teach you the basics if they see you as a serious investor.

, Arrange for payment, shipping and insurance. Each piece of art should be insured and catalogued as part of your estate.

, In order for an art investment to retain its value, it should be kept at low-humidity and avoid being marred. You may choose to hang it in your home, but you may want to get an art collector's advice about where to hang it and how to care for it.


Share this information with your children, if it is intended as an inheritance investment. They need to be well aware of how to take care of art, or they may lose money or ruin the painting entirely.

, As well as keeping tabs on the art world to understand the rise and falls of certain schools of art, an appraiser can tell you how your investment is maturing. They may clue you in on when you have reached your desired profit.

, If the art you buy does not fit in your home, and you will only be storing it, research banks, hotels and other institutions that rent fine art on a rotating basis. You may be able to demand thousands of dollars per year for your art to hang in another building. Keep in mind you will need to make sure your art is covered by an insurance policy for loss or damage.


Make sure the renter provides insurance for your art. You should prepare a contract that stipulates the time allotted, the fee, the insurance and the shipment of your art.

, Unless you employ an art dealer or auction house at the exact moment when the art is in high value, it can take years and thousands of dollars in fees to find the right buyer.

Keep your reference materials, sketches, articles, photos, etc, in one easy to find place.,
Make ""studies,"" or practice sketches, to organize effectively for larger projects.,
Limit the supplies you leave out to the project at hand.,
Keep an updated list of all of the necessary supplies, and the quantities of each.,
Break down bigger works into more easily completed parts.",How to Be an Organized Artist2," As you start planning for a project or work, you'll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches. While everyone has a strategy, there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to re-find the cool idea you saw three months ago. Try out:


Dedicating 1 notebook, preferably with insert folders, to each project.
Making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration.
Tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace., Very few artists simply dive right into large projects. Almost 100% of the time they instead work on related, smaller projects called ""studies"" to prepare for the larger work. You might practice the face of the portrait you're making, sketch our different composition ideas, or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture. Keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills, ideas, and supplies needed for the final project.

, At the end of the day, artists are visual people, and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process. Of course, neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies. Find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use, and leaving a little bit of ""essential"" clutter. It's okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio -- just make sure it's the inspiration you need for the current project.


Just because you ""aren't organized"" is no excuse not to make an attempt. Don't feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess-- there is a middle ground.

, Nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize you've run out of white paint halfway through a section. Once a week, or more frequently if possible, check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem.


A simple spreadsheet or notebook, marked at the end of each artistic session, is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff.

, Deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking. But sketching the idea, transposing the image onto the wall, painting the basic colors, then adding shading/detail are four separate and more manageable projects. Organization is key to big projects, even if it feels ""constraining"" to your creativity. In reality, organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative, instead of worrying about logistics.


Figure out the building blocks of each part of the project, tackling each at once. Don't jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly.

Keep all of your past work organized and accessible.,
Record all of your artistic contacts and connections in one place.,
Log the costs of supplies needed for each project.,
Find out how much it costs you to make and sell each piece.,
Pay attention to what other, similar works of art are selling for.,
Consider the ""cost"" of your time when pricing work.",How to Be an Organized Artist3," When you finish a project, whether it sells or not, don't just stuff it away in a drawer. You never know when you'll want to revisit and idea or, more excitingly, when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects.


If you do electronic work, back it up every 3-6 months on a dedicated hard drive. There is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects., More than many industries, successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists, curators, instructors, and gallery assistants to be successful. You never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand, or when you'll have some work you want to place in a friend's art show. Don't leave meetings and connections up to chance -- organize and compile your contact information in once place for later. Make notes of:


Phone number
Email
Location
Role in the art world
How you met or connected., If you're looking to make a living off art, you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business. This, however, does not need to interfere with your creative process. Simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy.


You can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes, as they are private business expenses. Keeping expenses organized isn't just about time, it is about saving money., If you're making the same or similar pieces each day, you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made. So, if 10 wood sculptures cost you $100, each sculpture cost you $10 to make (100/10 = 10). This may seem trivial, but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work.


At the very least, ensure that you are not losing money on each piece.

, If you want an organized, productive artistic practice, you need to know about the trends around your work. Keeping organized is about more than just your own studio, it is about understanding the art market you're a part of. Peruse Etsy, visit galleries and show openings, and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices.

, While it doesn't have a dollar value, make sure you value your time as well as your materials. In the earlier example, don't forget that it cost more than just $10 to make the sculpture. Your hours of work and experience are essential too, so don't sell the piece for $20 if it took you a week to make. While pricing your work is difficult, don't balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for -- not everyone can do what you do, and people are paying for your talent and experience.


At the very least, consider what you'd be paid if you used your time otherwise. Twenty hours spent painting could be worth $15 an hour at another job. You should consider this ""missed"" money when pricing work.
If you want to make art your living, you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself. Careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off.

Create a compelling reel or portfolio.,
Land an internship.,
Consider self-employment.,
Sign on with a design company or studio.,
Move up to a supervisor position.",How to Be a Visual Effects Artist2," This should be a short video showcasing the breadth and depth of your skills as an artist. Some choose to follow a storyline format while others cycle through a series of clips. Most college programs will give you time to create this work in your junior or senior years using professional grade equipment and software.Your reel is also a chance for you to showcase any unique skills that you possess, such as drawing or sculpting.Don’t be afraid to work with other artists to create your reel. Showing that you can collaborate well with others is something that studios often look for when hiring.

, If you are enrolled in a VFX program, talk to your career counselors to see what opportunities might be available. If you are developing your skills on your own, reach out to studios to see if they have any spots for paid or unpaid interns. This will give a potential employer a chance to get to know you and might make it easier for them to hire you in the future., Over half of VFX artists are their own bosses. Being a freelance designer gives you more control over your schedule and project selection. But, it also means that you will need to handle administrative tasks and could struggle with bringing in a consistent income.If this path interests you, it would be wise to take a few classes in marketing and accounting. Getting established is a hard struggle that many self-employed artists face.Choosing your own projects can mean that you’ll establish a specialty more quickly than you might in a large studio. However, affording the most recent design equipment may be tough, depending on how successful you are.

, This is a more traditional option where you agree to full or part-time employment with an established company. Your work schedule and salary will very much depend on the prominence of the company and the types of projects that come in. However, you may get the opportunity to work on some big Hollywood blockbusters or top-rated television shows!Get your foot in the door of larger companies by serving as a junior 2D artist or runner. A junior artist will assist those with seniority by creating basic outlines for scenery and the like. A runner literally runs sketches and communications between the VFX team and a director, for example., With enough time, effort, and luck, you may get the chance to take on a leadership position for a project. As a supervisor, the final product that audiences see is your responsibility. You’ll take all of the raw images and make them fit together while working alongside the production team."

Join a professional society.,
Enjoy working with a team.,
Expect long work hours.,
Spend time on a TV or film set.",How to Be a Visual Effects Artist3," Networking is a great way to find new opportunities and exchange ideas. Start establishing your network as soon as you decide to become a VFX artist. Join an industry group, such as the Visual Effects Society (VES). If you can’t fully join, then simply follow their activities and attend events when you can.The VES has almost 3,400 members spread across the entire world. Their work ranges from video games to television., Most VFX work situations will require that you communicate with a number of people as you complete a task. You may need to talk with directors, other VFX artists, and animators to create a unified vision for the final product. Taking communication courses in college is only one way you can learn how to communicate effectively.This also means that you will need to find ways to work with constructive criticism and feedback. Altering your final product based on information from the wider production team is often something that you just have to do. For example, a director might ask you to cut down a scene that you’ve spent weeks working on.
Pitching your creative vision and ideas to others is also an important part of the process. If you can make a product more memorable in an advertisement, for instance, then the creative team probably wants to know.

, Most VFX artists start work mid-morning and go until the late evening. Or, your shift could be an overnight one that ends in the early morning hours. The schedule very much depends on the deadlines that are looming and how the work is divided over time. You’ll want to be prepared for unpredictable timelines as a VFX artist.Partially due to the long hours, many VFX professionals describe their work setting as being pretty laid back in terms of dress and even behavior.

, If you are considering working in the entertainment industry, try to get out of your office and away from your computer and head to the actual sets. This will give you a chance to see how the production team works together on the ground. Pay attention to how each person’s job feeds into the final product."

Play games that allow you to practice improvisation.",How to Be Good at Improvisation," Some entire movies are improvised, some plays are. Sometimes a group gets together to improvise one scene or find ways to improve a scene. Sometimes a drama lesson can be a while series of different improvised scenes. A class leader may ask everyone to stand and improvise a moonwalk as an ice breaker. You might be put into small groups and given a set time to put together a scene. Improvisation covers a lot! Make sure you know exactly what you have to be good at.;
, Often in improvisation, you will be given a topic or scenario which determines what, where and who you are. Stay in character. Whoever has decided the scenario, wants to see your interpretation of it, not something completely off topic that you prefer to perform. Keep it appropriate. Don't introduce the fact you have a super power if you are supposed to be showing how to close a sale or pretend the room is starting to flood when you're meant to be being your interpretation of a clock that needs winding.

, Yes, some amusing words may get a laugh, but don't lose a good story line by trying to be too funny, unless that's your character. If you work with a partner, don't end up in a comedy contest, trying to be better than your partner.

, Focus on your acting; not the audience.

, Don't let fear hold you back. It can be scary to stand up in front of a crowd. Take a speech class to practice this and help you get over stage fright.

, If someone in your group says, ""I'm the best soccer player ever!"", don't cut him/her off and say, ""Really? I thought you were a gymnast!"" because you know that's what they really do. Remember the rest of the groups is improvising too.

, That always ends the show. Being energetic is great, in the right situation, but screaming and shouting or running around excessively just isn't always realistic.

, Being nervous can ruin the improvised scene. Relaxing and enjoying yourself can make the audience enjoy you.

, Imagine how that character would move, would react, would speak, would think, would feel. Show that in your actions.

, There are a lot of improvisation games that were show cased in the popular TV show Who's Line is it Anyway. Research that. Or try other options such acting a scene where everyone who speaks has to include a colour in their sentences. Or you can start a scene and as soon as the actors are in an opportune position, someone says pause, takes a character out, and starts the scene again at a completely different situations inspired by the position of the actors.

See if your local community college offers classes in touring production, stage lighting, or theatre management. You can also get a degree in stage management, theatre practice, or technical theatre. Whether you take one class or many, you’ll learn invaluable skills and tips for managing a production., To gain valuable experience, volunteer at your local high school, playhouse, or theatre. They are always looking for people to help make their production a success. They don't pay much (or none at all), so go into it with an open mind and open heart. You’ll get to be part of a production and make connections with others who have a love for theatre.


This is a great learning opportunity for someone who is older but looking to break into stage management. Volunteering allows you to work with more experienced people and gain knowledge of the industry.

, In order to become a stage manager, it is essential that you know how to do every job in the theatre. Work on the set, coordinate costumes, help with hair and makeup, become a prop master, assist the director, and learn how to work the rigging, stage lighting, and audio equipment.If you don’t have any theatre experience, try becoming a stagehand or spotlight operator first. You’ll work closely with the stage manager and learn what’s required for that role.

, Many large companies, like Disney Theatrical Group, offer internships for students. Taking a position like this can help you get your foot in the door and increase your chances of landing a job as a stage manager. Not only will you get to see amazing productions and work with professionals, there is also a chance you could get hired on permanently., Research theatres and playhouses in your area and visit each one. Bring your resume as well as any referrals or letters of recommendation, and inquire about stage management openings. If there are none, ask the person you speak to if they know of any openings., Middle schools, high school, colleges, and universities usually have theatre departments. Visit all the schools in your area and see if they have any openings for stage managers. This would be a great position for someone who enjoys working with kids. Make sure you are prepared for your visit by dressing professionally and bringing your credentials with you., Concert halls and other music venues, even outdoor rock and roll shows, also require stage directors. If you can’t find an opening at a theatre, try managing the stage for music productions. Many of the responsibilities, such as overseeing artists and keeping track of show times, will be similar. Plus, you’ll gain experience to add to your resume., Networking is a great way to find a job. Make connections with other people in the industry, especially from past productions you have worked on. If you show your coworkers that you are dedicated and knowledgeable, they may refer you when they hear of a stage manager position available.Reach out to people you already know in the industry. Ask for recommendations or referrals.
Attend as many productions as possible. Stick around after the performance and introduce yourself to members of the cast and crew, when appropriate.

, Wearing black is a must in all theaters; it keeps the crew from being too visible on the wings of the stage. Dressing conservatively is a must for all professional jobs, so be sure not to wear anything too showy or revealing -- you want to blend in, not stand out. Invest in several black tops and pants so you will always have a clean supply., A stage manager is a very demanding job, time-wise. You need to have enough time in your schedule to be early to every single event, whether it be a meeting, rehearsal, dress rehearsal, or a performance. You’ll also need to set up for every event, as well as clean up afterwards., Stage managers have a lot of people and things to keep track of. You must remain calm, cool, and collected. However, stand your ground when needed to make sure that things are progressing as they should be. Be assertive, but polite to the cast, crew, and guests.


Express yourself directly and openly. Don’t be afraid to tell others how you feel, or how you think they are doing in their own roles. Give specific examples of ways they can improve, and be sure to praise them when they follow your advice. Be firm but still friendly.

, Guests coming to see the production need to be treated well so they have the best possible experience. Though you will likely be busy with numerous other things, take guest’s requests or complaints seriously and do your best to attend to them.


For instance, if someone complains about gum on the floor, assure them it will be taken care of immediately, and then get someone from your crew or the house management crew to clean it up if you are in a tight spot.
If someone approaches you during a break in the performance and tells you they are unable to hear the dialogue or music, take steps to rectify the situation. Adjust the audio for that section of the theatre if others in the area are having similar trouble. You could also offer the person another seat in a different section, if possible.

, Stage managers are in charge of the entire production, so you must be a good leader for this job. You’ll need to know how to delegate tasks and manage other people. Stage managers must be patient, calm, and level-headed, especially when things go wrong.To be a great leader, you need to be an active listener. When someone is speaking with you, give them your undivided attention and make eye contact. Don’t interrupt or judge them, but do try to understand where they are coming from.
Great leaders also take responsibility for their actions. Own up to any mistakes you make, and realize that as the stage manager you will be responsible for mistakes that other people make as well. Make sure someone is able to effectively complete a task before delegating it.

, You’ll need to be able to communicate well with a variety of people on the cast and crew. Not only will you be in charge of the stage crew, you’ll also have to communicate with the director, choreographer, and actors. Stage managers also schedule meetings and call times, take notes during meetings, and write up rehearsal reports.Speak clearly and assertively to everyone you encounter. You should also be specific when making requests to others in order to avoid confusion.
Body language is also a part of communication. Demonstrate friendliness and approachability by using open body language, such as smiling and angling toward people who are speaking. Avoid frowning, crossing your arms, and fidgeting.

, There are many things for a stage manager to take care of and coordinate, so you’ll need to be organized. Keep a notebook for each production to jot down rehearsal and call times, contact info for the cast and crew, blocking notations from the director, etc.Pay attention to the details. You’ll need to keep track of everything from the names of the understudies to the quality of the gel sheets for the stage lights.
You can also make to-do lists, set deadlines for tasks, and multitask in order to get everything accomplished on time.

What do you want your workshop participants to learn? This analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching, concrete topics you will cover, or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants. Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important.Some examples of workshop objectives include:


Learn how to write a persuasive cover letter.
Learn how to break bad news to a patient.
Learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class.
Learn how to create an effective Powerpoint presentation.;
, Will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers? Will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it? Are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training? Answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop.For example, if your audience already knows each other, you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly. If they are complete strangers, you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions.

, These are the times when participants are most awake and alert.

You want your participants to be fully engaged and aware. If you can, avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient., Pass around flyers, hang up posters, or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation. Having a catchy title helps, as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessary.Be sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch people's attention.

, A workshop is not the same as a large lecture. You want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions, practice their skills, and work together. But you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting. Ideally a workshop will have 8-15 participants.Sometimes you don't have a choice about your group size. If you have a very large group, find creative ways to make sure the size doesn't become overwhelming. For example, a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different break-out groups of 8 participants each. You could also bring in co-facilitators and co-presenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal.

, Some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place. Perhaps they have to study journal articles, write a short story, or read one another's work. If your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place, be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning.


Be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time. Be clear about where and how your students should submit their work. Will they have to give you hard copies, or will you circulate materials by email?

, Most workshops are time-limited. They can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days. But no matter what, you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participants.Rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time, think about the most important skills, techniques, and information you want your audience to gain. Prioritize those in your lesson plan.

, Adults learn in all kinds of ways: visually, orally, through hands-on practice, or any combination of the above.Remember that you might not know your participants' learning styles ahead of time, so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared. Depending on the topic and objective of your workshop, you might want to prepare paper handouts, audio-visual aids, computer-based lesson plans, and role-playing activities., Readings, case studies, lists of key terms, and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare. It is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time. That way you can catch typos or errors. Be sure to use a large, easy-to-read font. Give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future.


If you have lengthy readings, consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in prepared.If you are handing out numerous documents, consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized. If you give this workshop often enough, you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees.

, If you plan to present a slideshow, video clips, or sound clips, you will have to prepare these ahead of time. Test them at home to make sure they are working correctly. Make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space.


It is wise to consult with your venue's a/v technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly. Not all projectors are compatible with Macintosh computers, for example. And some rooms might not have sound projection. Make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use.

, If your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum, you will need to organize these materials ahead of time.Think about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices, and notify them if so.


If your participants will be expected to do activities online, be sure to consult with your venue's a/v technician. You will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet, and you might have to ask for the network's password in advance.

, Depending on the topic and size of your workshop, you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning. An expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique; a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important; and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group. If you require help from anyone, make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time. The more prepared they are, the better your workshop will be.

, Interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning. Brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshop's objectives. Keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs, small groups, or as a full group. Make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop. Some possible group activities include:


Debates. Break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position.
Think-pair-shares. Ask your participants a discussion question. Have them think about it on their own, discuss their thoughts with a partner, and then share their conclusions with the full group.
Question-and-answer sessions. If you have a lot of information to present, include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material. You can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them.
Role-playing activities. Assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning.
Brainstorming sessions. Ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of. Write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard. Then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with.

, People are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks.They are also more likely to remember what they have learned. Schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5-minute break per hour of your workshop. This will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable.

, Actual activities can often take 10-20% more time than we estimate.If you think a q-and-a session will last 10 minutes, it might very well last 12 minutes or longer. Build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover. Resist the urge to cram in as much as possible: your participants will feel tired and rushed.


If you are worried that your workshop will end early, you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning. If you have time for them, great! And if not, no harm done.

, Workshops take a lot of work and energy. Help keep your participants' energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages.Ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop. You should not have to pay for snacks out-of-pocket.


Try to avoid junk foods. Unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon. That will leave your participants bored and tired. Aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit, vegetables, hummus, and whole grain breads., Leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room. You might have to meet with a/v technicians, caterers, or your team members before your workshop begins as well. Give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make last-minute adjustments to your workshop plan., Computers, laptops, projectors, and speakers will all have to be fine-tuned in advance. After all, you want your workshop time to be productive: you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology. If you can, see if you can have the venue's a/v technician assist you with the set-up. You might not be familiar with the room's technological capabilities, and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently.

, The way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group, the size of the room, and the activities you have planned. Ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi-circle: this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation.If everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo, perhaps a semi-circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate., If you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out, place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop. Make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled. Other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include:


Snacks and beverages.
Name-tags and markers.
Pens and pencils.

, Arriving early allows you to set up, relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop. This helps in building relationships with the participants.

, Once everyone is seated, you will have to orient them to your workshop. Be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you. Give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it. Explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important. It is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared. Try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes.


Even if your topic is a serious one, consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another.
Explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them. For example, you can ask people to fill out name-tags, grab a cup of coffee, and make sure they have their handouts. If you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away, you can tell them when those materials will be needed.

, Ask your participants to introduce themselves. Limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions, such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop. You don't want the icebreakers to go on forever, but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group.


You can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a light-hearted question like ""What is your favorite movie?"" or ""What is your favorite bad song?""

, This is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action. Have your outline in front of you, and try to stick to the outline if you can. Feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why. Your lesson plan doesn't have to be a surprise, and your participants might appreciate being told why you've organized the workshop in the way that you did. For example, you might tell them:


""First we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances. After that, we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem.""
""We're going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program. After I explain these terms, we'll take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page. After that, we will open things up for discussion.""
""Please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you. In a few minutes, you will role-play a counselor-student interaction with your partner.""

, It is good to have a plan for your workshop, but be prepared to alter your workshop's content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants. Build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions, concerns, and interests.You can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on. This will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content.

, Always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity. Interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problem-solving techniques.

A workshop is not the same thing as a lecture, and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants. Let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them. For example, you can:

Deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions.
Divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group.
Show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions.
Provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to role-play the scenario.
Have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique.

, You do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop. Your participants might get bored or annoyed.Keep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting: it is a format that thrives on interaction, activity, and group work., Scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect. Let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks. This allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage, phone calls and other personal needs. Do not skip breaks, even if you are running short on time.

, Attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity. View this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem. Change up your activities, ask your participants to rearrange their chairs, or schedule a break at least once every 20-30 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated., Even if you are treating a serious topic, humor can be a great way to emphasize information and keep everyone attentive.Think about ways that you can introduce humor in a responsible, ethical way into your presentations, discussions, and activities. This will also encourage your participants to remain relaxed, alert, and comfortable.

, Make sure that all of your workshop participants are treated equally and respectfully.This means that any leadership roles (such as group discussion leader) should be distributed evenly across the workshop. Encourage quiet, shy participants to speak. You want everyone to feel heard and respected. Similarly, you do not want a single participant's voice (or your own voice for that matter) to dominate the discussion.

, Most workshops will run smoothly. After all, the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn. However, there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague. Be professional no matter what, and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behavior.Be clear in what you expect from your participants. If you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague, consider speaking privately with that person. Emphasize the importance of what you are teaching, and tell them that you expect adult, professional behavior from them.

, Explain everything that your participants have learned over the course of the session.This will help emphasize how far they have come and what new skills they have acquired. Refer explicitly to the objectives you laid out at the beginning of the workshop, and explain how you think the participants have met those objectives. Congratulate your workshop for their hard work and for their new knowledge.

, Design an evaluation form that your participants can fill out in the last few minutes of the workshop. Be sure that you leave them with enough time to comment and consider your questions carefully.Immediate feedback not only will help you improve your workshop but will also help reinforce the learning your participants have undertaken.Good questions to ask include:

What is the stated objective of this workshop? Did the workshop meet its stated objective?
What activities helped your learning the most? The least?
Was the workshop an appropriate length?
What workshop materials (handouts, readings, quizzes, etc.) were the most useful? Which ones were the least useful?
How have you learned or grown from this workshop?
How do you think your colleagues have learned or grown?
How would you change this workshop in the future? Any suggestions for improvements?
Are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on?

, Ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input. Some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences. Following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights. You can ask additional questions such as:


How well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop?
Do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop?
How has the workshop helped you at work? Were there ways it could have helped you more?
What materials have you found useful since the workshop? What materials have you thrown away or forgotten about?

, If enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop, consider scheduling a Part 2. In the follow-up workshop, you can address more of their questions, dig more deeply into the topic, or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in Part 1. Be sure that your follow-up workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for more advanced attendees.

Follow the doctor's advice.",How to Deal With Fainting Spells," There are a number of symptoms, referred to as pre-syncope, that you may experience immediately before fainting. Most fainting spells occur when you are standing, and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint. In addition, awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint.


Common symptoms include yawning, a sudden sweat, nausea (sickness), fast and deep breathing, confusion, lightheadedness, blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes, and ringing in your ears. ;
, The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning. If you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct 'antigravity' measures, which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms, can help you avoid a fainting episode.


Medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees. These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode. If standing, you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles. This is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately. , By preparing, you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint. Try telling someone near you what is happening and ask for assistance, try lying down, or try bracing yourself against a wall to prepare. If you find yourself on stairs or other precarious surroundings, sit down and hold on to a railing immediately.


If you do faint, blood flow will resume to your brain naturally and you should regain consciousness in two minutes or less., It is normal to feel weak and confused for 20 to 30 minutes after fainting. Remain calm when you regain consciousness. Also, take some time to lay on your back to allow blood flow back to the brain. You should also hydrate yourself with water. , Fainting spells are not necessarily an indication of a serious medical condition. In fact, fainting spells may be caused by anxiety, fear, pain, emotional stress, hunger, dehydration, surprise, overexertion, clenching, spasms, choking, or drug and alcohol use. If you suspect that your fainting spells are being caused by one of these issues, there are measures you can take to prevent future episodes.

, Hydration is the best way to prevent fainting spells without medication. Drinking more water is ideal, but you can get fluids from food sources (like watermelon), milk, soups, etc. All caffeinated beverages, including sodas, should be eliminated. If you are sufficiently hydrated, you will be urinating regularly and your urine will be clear or light colored, not dark. Caffeine stimulates the heart, making fainting spells more likely to occur. If you drink large amounts of caffeine, you should cut back slowly to avoid headaches.
While the amount of fluids you need each day depends on a number of factors — including your level of activity, your climate, your overall health and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should drink about half of your weight in ounces each day. So if you weigh 200 lbs. then you should be consuming 100 oz (or 12.5 8-oz glasses) of fluids each day.If you are an athlete with more muscle-mass, you should drink about two-thirds of your weight in ounces.Eating regularly can also help to reduce lightheadedness and reduce your chance of fainting by boosting blood sugar.

, If anxiety and stress are causing fainting spells, calming techniques can help you avoid fainting spells. You can try counting your breaths or deep breathing, flexing and relaxing different muscle groups, and paying attention to the immediate moment rather than the past or future (also known as mindfulness). Avoid placing yourself in stressful situations and do your best to remove yourself from such situations. Learning to stay calm and to assert yourself can help you to overcome feelings of anxiety.

, The flushed look that many people get when they drink alcohol is actually blood rushing to the surface of the skin. This takes blood away from the brain, and can cause fainting episodes. Excessive drinking also causes dehydration, which is a leading cause of fainting spells. Illegal drugs, particularly stimulants such as cocaine or ecstasy, also cause fainting spells. These should be avoided.

, While it is possible that fainting spells are not related to medical conditions, it is also possible that they are a sign of a medical problem. To determine this, you will need to visit your doctor. You should see your doctor immediately if you experience fainting while exercising, if fainting occurs with rapid heartbeat, or if your family has a history of fainting. If you experience repeated fainting spells, you should consult your doctor. , Your doctor will ask a number of questions to determine the cause of your fainting. These may include the situation you find yourself in when you faint, how long the episodes last, how quickly it takes you to return to normal, and any other symptoms you may experience during the episodes. The doctor may also order a number of tests to determine the cause of your fainting spells.


An electrocardiogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects a heart condition is the cause.
An electroencephalogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects something in the brain is the cause. , There is a chance that your doctor will not recommend any medication for your fainting spells. There is no medicine that treats fainting spells themselves, so your doctor may instead prescribe a medicine to treat the cause of the fainting spells. These may include medicine for low blood sugar, seizures, anemia, or low blood pressure.


If any medications are prescribed, be sure to take them exactly as your doctor advises.

If they can't, you or another caregiver will need to help them. Even if they can, you might need to provide them with reminders and the tools to take care of their hygiene. Bathing, dental care, nail care, hair care, and changing clothes are all tasks your parent may need help with. For bathing, you may be able to help your parent into a shower chair (using a wheelchair), where they can mostly bathe themselves with some supervision. On the other hand, they may need a sponge bath.
If your parent is completely bedridden, you'll need to bring items to them. For instance, you can bring a toothbrush, a cup with clean water, and a spitting cup over to the bed. Let the person brush their teeth or ask them to open their mouth so you can brush their teeth.
Make sure you are helping them trim their nails regularly. They will likely need help with their toenails, even if they don't need help with their fingernails. You'll also need to help the person shave. An electric razor works best for this process, particularly if you've never shaved anyone else.;
, Being bedridden comes with certain health risks that you need to help watch out for if you're providing care for your parent. For instance, bed sores are a common problem. They generally appear where the person's body touches the mattress, such as the bottom of the feet, the shoulders, the buttocks, and the back of the head.To combat pressure sores, try to change your parent's position every 2 hours, and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible. You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points.
Pay attention to the sheets. They should be cotton or silk, and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them, as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores.
Make sure your parent's skin is moisturized regularly. Also, avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder, as those can dry out the skin. Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores. It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day.
On people with darker skin, you may see blue or purple patches, while the patches will be red or white on lighter-skinned people. Cracks, wrinkles, swelling, shiny areas, blisters, and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores. Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs.

, When laying in bed regularly, liquids can build up in the lungs, leading to congestion and even pneumonia. The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly, preferably every 2 hours., The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side. When your parent becomes bedridden, they can't do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly.Encourage people to come over and visit with your parent, so they have regular interaction.
Also, try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible. For instance, if your parent enjoys making art, get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table.
It's also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about what's going on. They need a sounding board as much as you do. You can be this person some of the time, but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well. If you are their only source of support, then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on.

, Often, a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs. A social worker can benefit you, too, as they can help you find the care you need for your parent, as well as other resources.Most hospitals have social services on site, though you can also visit a Medicare/Medicaid office in your local community, or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through.

, When your parent is sick, you may feel like you're alone in the situation. However, more often than not, friends and family would like to help you, but they don't know how. Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help.It is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family. Try saying, ""I'm creating a weekly schedule for Mom's care. Please let me know which two days you would like this week.""
Offer a specific task if they don't seem to know how to help.
If you have children, then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent. Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times.

, If your parent has become bedridden, it's likely you'll need some help from professional caregivers. If you're caring for the person at home, you can get help from people who come to the house. If the person will need long-term care, you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care. If your parent has a terminal illness, hospice care may provide some relief.Both in-home care and care facilities can be expensive. Insurance and medicare may cover some in-home care (which sometimes includes in-home care at senior facilities).
Have a talk with your parent about getting some help. They may not like the idea much, as some people are reluctant to have outside help. If you need help persuading them, try asking someone who's been in a similar situation to help. It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you. You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead, such as a close friend, a cousin, or a spiritual leader.
You can hire whatever level of care you need. For instance, some non-medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals. However, if your parent needs medical care, you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help, though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor.

, When your parent is bedridden, you likely will have a surplus of emotions, which is perfectly normal. You may find you feel anger or resentment. You might feel guilty that you can't spend more time with them or that they're bedridden and you're not. You also may feel anxiety about the situation. Grief is also common, as you've lost who your parent was.Let yourself feel those emotions. Acknowledge them, and give yourself permission to feel them. Also, make sure you find someone to talk to. Anyone with a sympathetic ear will do.Writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better. Try keeping a journal as well.
You can also talk with others who are facing the same issue. You can join a local support group or find one online. In fact, if your parent is on hospice, many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation. Just knowing you're not alone can help.
Professional counseling can also be beneficial. If your parent is bedridden, particularly if they have a terminal illness, it can be difficult to come to terms with that, especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent. A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with what's happening., When it comes to a parent's failing health, you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable. When you have questions about your parent's health, ask the doctors and nurses. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to explain it in layperson's terms. You deserve to know what's going on (with your parent's consent, of course).Taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful. Emotions may be high, which might make it hard for you to remember everything.

, Take time to do things you normally do for your spiritual self, such as praying or meditating. These activities can have a calming effect in a stressful situation. Of course, not everyone considers themselves a spiritual person, and that may be the case with you. Nonetheless, it can still help to take a few minutes each day to just be or sit in silence., When you're taking care of a parent, it can be difficult to find time for yourself to do things you enjoy. However, it's very important to take time each day to relax if you can. It can be something seemingly insignificant, like drawing a little picture or watching the birds outside. Whatever it is, take some time each day to do something you enjoy.Similarly, it's important to maintain the relationships in your life. Try to get away to spend time with people you care about, so you can just be you for a while.At the very least, set aside some time each day to return calls, respond to text messages, or check in with your other loved ones.
Also, take time to escape. That is, sometimes, escaping into the fantasy world of a book, movie, or television show can give you the mental break you need. You can even enjoy these with your parent. Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break.Be sure to schedule this time in. Don’t wait until you feel like you need a break.

, When you're providing care, you need to make sure you know what your limits are. Determine how much time you can actually give, as well as how much physical care you can give. Be firm with those limits, and get help as needed.For example, it is important to maintain your relationship with your spouse/partner and children (if you have them). This might mean that certain times of the day will be set aside for spending time with your family, such as dinner time.

, When you're caring for someone, it can be easy to neglect your physical health, but it's important to make that a priority, too. Make sure you're eating enough and that you're eating healthy meals with lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Try to get some exercise in when you can, as it will lower your stress level and keep you healthy.In addition, make getting enough sleep a priority. Even if you can get enough sleep all at at once, try to work in 7 to 9 hours a day to make sure you'll be able to function.
Finally, make sure you are keeping up your regular doctor's appointments and dental care, so that you stay healthy."

Bolster your immune system.",How to Be Healthy," Adult humans should drink 2-3 litres(or roughly eight 8 oz glasses) of water per day whilst children should drink 1-2 litres ( or roughly five 8 oz glasses.That is in addition to things like tea and coffee. Water keeps bodies at the correct temperature and removes toxins that are the inevitable result of metabolism and industrial life. You'll be healthier automatically.


Water also clears your skin, helps your kidneys, helps to control your appetite, and keeps you energized.If being healthier, more wakeful, and having better skin isn't motivation, what is?
It also keeps you from drinking unhealthy beverages like soda and juice, which are high in calories. The body barely registers the intake of these unhealthy drinks and yet you still feel thirsty hundreds of calories later. If you need the taste, splash some lemon, lime, or 100% juice into your water. However, be sure that you eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, such as broccoli, to support healthy bones as you grow older.;
, A light, healthy breakfast is sufficient enough to reap the benefits of eating early. If it's comprised of lean protein and whole grains, then it will keep you from gorging at lunch. Research shows that breakfast-skippers actually eat more! So, to curb your appetite, don't skip the first meal of the day.


Instead of two chocolate doughnuts and a coffee that's more cream than anything else, opt for eggs, fruit, and for a beverage, skimmed milk, fresh orange juice, or tea. The healthier your breakfast is, the more energized you'll feel throughout the day and the more you won't need to eat later in the day., If half of your plate is vegetables and fruit, you're on the right track.Add in lean protein, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Once a steady eating pattern has been established, your body will feel more comfortable. There may be a period of time when your body is wondering where the sugary foods went, but once you're over the hump, you'll feel better than ever.


Remember that not all fats are bad for you. Good fats can be found in oily fish like salmon and tuna, avocados, nuts, and olive oil. These are essential to a well-balanced diet. Read How to Eat Healthy for more tips.

, A good time for a healthy, easy-to-digest evening meal is between 17:00 and 20:00; it's best to avoid late night snacks because they fill you with unnecessary calories and can disrupt your sleep. If you do need that midnight snack, stick to unsalted nuts, seeds, fruits, and veggies.


Snacking isn't bad for you if you do it right. In fact, eating ""constantly"" can keep you from feeling deprived and going for that third piece of cheesecake when the cart rolls around. Just make sure it's all in moderation., In case you haven't noticed, meat hasn't played much of a role in what we've talked about so far. Being vegetarian is a good way to reduce your calorie intake and get loads of vitamins and minerals, but that being said, it can be done wrong. While it's not the best idea to go fully vegetarian, most people do eat far too much meat. A good idea is to change the amount and types of meat you eat: swap pork chops for lean chicken; steak for tuna.


A high-fiber diet is easily had without meat. Fiber has been shown to lower your cholesterol, control your blood-sugar levels, improve your bowel health, and make you less likely to overeat. The recommended fiber intake is 30g a day for men and 21g for women; after the age of 50, this jumps up to 38g for men and 25g for women. Some good sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables (with the skin), whole grains, and legumes., Processed foods get a bad rap, and often for good reason. However, you've got to choose your battles. That frozen bag of broccoli isn't nearly as bad as that boxed mac and cheese. In short, avoid processed foods when you can — but if you can't, read the labels and watch for added bad stuff: salt, sugar, and fat.


Food that stays on the shelves often has added sodium, words that end in -ose, and trans and saturated fats in the ingredient list. If you see these on the label (especially if they're in high amounts), avoid them. You can find a healthier alternative elsewhere. It's not worth it.

Just because it says it has no trans fat doesn't actually mean it has no trans fat. Negligible amounts can be legally ignored — so if you see hydrogenated vegetable oil on the list, you've found one of the masked culprits., In addition to helping you lose weight and gain confidence, exercising has a host of other benefits for your body and mind. Having good cardiovascular health has been linked to a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s, just to name one. So hit the pool, the pavement, or the park as often as you can.Exercising boosts your immune system too; even a change as minor as walking briskly for 20-30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your immune system by increasing both your antibody and T-killer cell response.Exercising is also one of the absolute best ways to sleep better at night—which can help you lose weight by keeping you from overeating. Read How to Get Fit for more details.

, Our physical frames vary in size and weight. An individual with a large frame can carry a little more weight while a person with a light frame will be able to carry less.


Being underweight isn't a good thing either! Do not use any form of crash diets. There is no magic bullet for weight loss—and even if there were, starving your body of vital nutrients wouldn’t be it. A slow change in your eating habits is much safer and the long-term benefits for your physical health are greater.
If you don't want to go on a diet, read How to Lose Weight Just by Exercising. Just remember that only serious athletes are able to burn off enough calories to be able to enjoy massive indulgences—and even so, they tend not to because it’s hard on the body. Even if you do consume more calories than are recommended for you, be sure that they are nutritious; your heart, brain, muscles, bones, organs, and blood can’t run forever on empty calories.

, Just because you can run 5 miles (8.0 km) without stopping doesn't mean you're healthy—same goes for lifting weights the size of a small car. If you only do one activity, you're only using one set of muscles.You'll be shocked when you go swimming or do core workouts that you can't keep up!


What's the answer? Cross training. Not only does doing several different activities work all your muscles (which can help prevent injury), it also keeps you from getting bored. That's the ultimate exercise killer! So include aerobic and strength training workouts to your routine. Your muscles will be glad you did.

, It should go without saying that there are bad ways to work out. Every time you get moving you put yourself at risk for injury, so make sure you're doing it right!


First things first, stay hydrated. You should always be sipping water during your workouts. Getting dehydrated can lead to dizziness or headaches during your sweat session (or lack thereof).Take breaks! It isn't being lazy, it's being healthy. You can't go-go-go forever. After 30 minutes or so of exercise, grab your water bottle and lighten up. Your body needs a second to catch up. You'll be able to go further in the long run.

, Being physically active isn't about pounding the pavement or joining a gym—it's a lifestyle that can be had 24/7. If you can add extra 10 steps to your day here and there, they add up.


Don't have any ideas? Park a bit farther away from work, the mall entrance, or the grocery store. Ride a bike to work or school. Take the stairs. Walk the dog every day. Take lunch to the park. Bike to work or the local coffee shop. Little opportunities are everywhere.

, It's amazing how much power our minds have over everything in our lives. A simple positive twist on a situation can turn an obstacle into an opportunity. Not only will you have more gusto for life, your immune system can fight off colds and heart disease better!Harvard wouldn't lie.


To start this difficult step, focus on gratitude. When you start thinking about the bad thing swirling around you, stop. Cut it out. Think of two things you're grateful for. Eventually, your mind will notice the pattern and stop the negativity before you have to consciously do it.

, This doesn't mean ""be content with your life"" (well, it does, but give it a sec)—it sort of means ""satisfy yourself"". If you're on a diet, allow yourself a (small) bit of what you're craving. If watching the Golden Girls for three hours on a Friday night sounds like heaven, do it. Whatever the small things are that make you happy, do them.


Your happiness is invaluable. If you're not happy, you're not fully healthy. It's when we've got our heads on straight that we can attack everything else. If work, family, friends, a relationship, and money are wearing you down, the choice between that hot pocket and that whole wheat bagel doesn't really matter!

, When we concentrate on unattainable goals, we get daunted, frustrated, and lazy. After all, why try to achieve something that will never happen? A healthy mindset has to be in the here and now. It should have concern for the future, sure, but it shouldn't be preoccupied with what hasn't happened yet or won't.


Being emotionally healthy (and happy) is easier to attain when you focus on the steps of your journey as opposed to the destination. If you want to make it on Broadway, focus on getting your next audition. Then focus on becoming equity, then focus on moving, etc. Now will always come before the future—focus on them in order!

, This one is huge. When stress takes over our lives, everything else falls apart. Our homes get cluttered, our minds get cluttered, and our relationships get strained. Take yourself aside for five minutes and think about your stress levels—how are you managing it? What could you do to be more calm and relaxed?


A very healthy way of managing stress is doing yoga. If that doesn't sound appealing, how about meditating? No? Then simply make sure to take ten minutes out of your day to just power down. Sit with yourself and just breathe. Make a point to get centered every day.

, We all know those people that seem to drain us, but yet we're friends with them anyway because they have a nice TV or because, well, we get bored. Unfortunately, for our emotional health, they've got to go. They do us no good and we know it — we just ignore it to maintain consistency and avoid awkward situations. Do your mental health a favor and tear off that band-aid. In the long-run, you'll be happier.


Not sure how to recognize a toxic friend? How to end a toxic friendship? We've got you covered.

, One of the best feelings to easily come by is that feeling of ""I got so much done today!"" For that moment, you feel virtually unstoppable. Your mom saying ""If you put your mind to it, you can do it"" is no longer a lie! Now imagine riding that high constantly.


Start by creating a to-do list. A calendar or planner is a good idea, too. And remember: think small. Attack a few small things to get you going. You'll get on a roll before you even realize it.

, This is similar to the ""Be Satisfied"" step; you need to do what's right for you sometimes, regardless of what the world seems to be demanding. Without feeling guilty, take that proverbial Kit Kat Bar. Spend a night in. Take a morning off. You'll be twice as energized when you get back to it.


This goes for exercise too. If you do the same thing over and over, your muscles get used to it, you get bored, and you end up plateauing. So instead of pounding the pavement on Wednesday, go hit the pool. You're not being lazy—you're being logical.

, Even if you master every other aspect of health, it won’t feel complete if you’re suffering from inner turmoil. Everyone needs a pick-me-up sometimes, and there are many small things that you can do to feel better about yourself. If the problem extends deeper, you may need to learn to cope with emotional pain or even depression.


Once you have worked on yourself, you should work on your approach to interpersonal relationships. Learn how to recognize a manipulative or controlling relationship and, if necessary, deal with emotional abuse so that you can have a healthy relationship.

, Taking unnecessary risks is hard on the body and mind. It can also have devastating long-term consequences. Serious or established patterns of risk-taking can also be indicative of deeper psychological problems, in which case you should talk to a healthcare professional who specializes in a relevant field. Start by setting your sights on one or more of the following achievements:


Have Safer Sex
Stop Binge Drinking
Quit Drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous
Quit Smoking
Beat Drug Addiction
Things like wearing a helmet when riding a bicycle and wearing your seatbelt when in your car.

These things are doable. While they are definitely daunting, they're doable. Often if one of these is accomplished, other things seem much easier and will fall into place.
If you already don't engage in risky behavior, congratulations!



, We've stressed the ""get fit"" part already, but now we want to make it a little less ignorable. Your daily/weekly routine needs to include exercise. It will increase your metabolic rate, control your weight, and you'll feel fresh the whole week. Triple win!


Here's something concrete for you: aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity every week (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) and strength training twice a week.Even mowing the lawn counts!

, When you sleep, your body produces cells that fight infection, inflammation, and stress—which means that getting too little sleep or poor-quality sleep not only makes you more prone to getting sick, but also increases the time you need to recover from illness. If you're not sleeping for you, sleep for your health!On top of that, a study conducted by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition demonstrated that men who slept for 4 hours consumed 500 more calories than they did after sleeping for 8 hours.If you're looking for an easy diet, here it is!

, Cooking your own meals is a wonderful experience as you can try out different recipes while saving money at the same time. What's more, you get to control every little thing that goes into your body. That's really the only way to turn your diet around!


When you cook, avoid using fatty oils and extra add-ons. Stick to olive oil instead of vegetable oil, butter, or margarine and keep the extra salt and cheese to a minimum. If it doesn't taste good without it, try cooking it differently!

, Wash your hands often, especially after visiting the bathroom at home or using the restrooms in a public place. Germs can spread like wildfire and bring us down in the blink of an eye. And as if it wasn't already clear, taking a shower is a good idea too.


When it comes to your mouth, floss and brush your teeth and tongue after eating; food particles are often the cause of bad breath and gum disease. Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and to catch any problems before they become serious. See How to Be Hygienic for more details.

, Maintaining healthy habits and a high level of energy is difficult for anyone who constantly battles fatigue, colds, infections, or any other effects of a weakened immune system. Read How to Develop a Strong Immune System for more information.


If you can help it, try to get all your necessary vitamins and minerals from your diet. Supplements should only be used as a secondary measure.And of course, talk to your doctor before you undergo any significant changes.

Or, and this applies for dogs and cats, you can install a pet door, allowing your pet to go in and out as it pleases. If you have a caged pet, make sure to change out the scraps (newspaper shreds or the cage shavings you can buy at a pet store) frequently. For a fish, clean the filter (if you have one; some fishbowls don't need one) once a month. Also, make sure that the water stays clean.

, This part is pretty much geared toward cats and dogs (Any pet that doesn't have to live in a cage or a bowl. It's hard to get a goldfish to shake your hand!). If you want to keep it from doing something, punish it. For dogs, hit it (not smack-hard, but with a little force) on the nose and tell it that was not good, or it's a bad dog. But don't lean in close to it's face or scream at it. Just use a little force in your voice. For cats, tell it it's a bad kitty and hit it on the head. Like I said before, only with a little bit of force. If you want to commend your pet for something, give a treat, and shower it in praise. For example, if you are trying to get your pet to shake your hand, gently grab its paw and shake it, while saying, ""Shake,"" repeatedly. Then, give it a treat and give it many complements. Do this about four or five times, then hold your hand out to it and say, ""Shake."" If your pet automatically puts its paw there, give it a treat and praise it.

, Make sure your pet always knows that you love it. Play with it or pet it or, and I know this sounds crazy, talk to it. Tell it it's a good pet.

, If it needs any shots, make sure to get the pet its shots right away.


If there are any problems with your pet, always go to the vet. Better safe than sorry.

, Only animals that are injured or too tame to survive in the wild should live in captivity.

, Don't buy a pet, instead, adopt a friend. There are tons of animals (mainly horses,dogs, and cats) that are unwanted all over. Go to an SPCA or animal shelter. Don't forget! Animal shelters have small animals and birds too!

, If it's not practical for you to adopt, volunteering is always a great idea. It differs from shelter to shelter, but here are some of the things you might be able to do at a shelter:


Play with the puppies and kittens to help them socialize. This prepares them for being adopted.
Clean cages and litterboxes.
Walk dogs.
Feed the animals and refresh their water.

, Protecting the planet means protecting animals' habitats, which are vital for the animals.

, For example, hunting may not seem ""animal friendly"", but in some circumstances, it is (like if it's in an area where there's not enough food or a disease).

, Sign petitions, donate, and spread the word. Tell your friends why to be animal-friendly, and try to get them to become animal friendly too.

Your parents may already have a feeding schedule set up, with set times in the day for feeding your pet. You should follow this feeding schedule and ask your parents if you can help them with giving your pet food and water on a daily basis.You can help your parents put your pet’s food in their bowl and make sure that your pet eats all of their food. You may also be allowed to give your pet a healthy treat, with the supervision of a parent.
Always ask your parents if it’s time to feed the pet before you do it yourself. Your pet may have a strict feeding schedule so they are not overfed or underfed.
If you have a pet dog, rabbit, bird or hamster, you should also keep an eye on your pet’s water dish as your pet may end up drinking a lot of water throughout the day. Try to always keep it full with fresh water. If you are younger than 10 years old, you may need help lifting and pouring water into your pet’s water dish.;
, You can also be a good pet owner by making sure you clean up after your pet. This means picking up any food that falls out of their food bowl and wiping up any water around their water dish so their feeding area is clean. You can also pick up any pet toys and put them in a bin or in one area so they are not scattered all over the house.You may also be able to help your parents clean your pet’s cage or living area. If you have a pet hamster, bird, lizard, or rabbit, you may help your parents remove and replace the newspaper lining in your pet’s cage or help them pick up droppings in the cage. If you have a fish, you may help your parents change out the water in the fish tank so it is clean and fresh.
Make sure you always wear gloves or use a tissue to pick up any pet droppings. Wash your hands well after touching your pet’s droppings.

, You can also pitch in and groom your pet on a regular basis. Depending on the type of pet you have, this may mean brushing your dog, rabbit, or cat once a day. You may be able to do this on your own or with the supervision of your parents.If you have a dog, you can also make sure your pet gets a bath once a week and stays clean. You may help your parents bathe your pet or bathe your pet yourself. Make sure you use the right techniques to bath your pet.
Do not try to bath other pets like a rabbit, a bird, a hamster or a cat. These animals can self clean themselves and do not need regular baths.
If your pet is a dog, you should check your pet for fleas or ticks on a daily basis. If you notice your pet has fleas or ticks, you should tell your parents.

, If you have a pet dog, you will need to walk them on a daily basis, especially if your dog is medium to large in size. You should create a walking schedule with your parents and assist your parents in walking your pet. You may put the collar or harness on the dog and take a turn holding the leash during the walk, with the supervision of a parent.If your dog is a puppy, you should only walk him a five to ten minutes a day. Ask your parents about how often you can walk your new puppy and follow their directions.
If you have other pets, like a cat, a bird, a hamster, or a rabbit, you may not need to walk them. Instead, you should spend time playing with these pets so they still get some exercise.

, You should spend at least ten to fifteen minutes a day playing with your pet so they feel loved and acknowledged by you. You should also use encouraging words and reward them with a treat if they behave well.


Make sure you use your fingers to gently pet and stroke your pet. Always be gentle when playing with your pet so you do not hurt them.
Use pet toys to play with your pet. You may use a light pen to stimulate your pet fish or a treat to teach your bird a fun new trick. You can also use balls to play with a pet cat or a pet dog.
Try not to play with your pet too often and give your pet some downtime during the day. Your pet needs time to nap and rest so they are not overly tired or stressed.

, Your pet should be trained properly to ensure they live well with you and your parents. A well trained pet will also be less of an issue when they meet other pets and strangers outside of your home. You should discuss your pet’s training with your parents and be sure it includes basic obedience commands, especially if your pet is a dog.


You should work with your parents to teach your pet dog to sit, stay, and come when called. You should also learn how to calm your dog down when someone is at the door or when your dog is around new people and new dogs.

, You should also avoid giving your pet any food or treats that are not allowed by your parents. Giving your pet unhealthy food could conflict with their training and lead to health issues.You should also avoid giving your pet food from your plate the table, even when your parents aren’t looking. This can conflict with your pet's training schedule and their feeding schedule.
Do not put unhealthy food in your pet's cage. Some pets are not allowed to have human food because it can make them sick so always check with your parents before giving your pet a treat.

, Your parents will likely have their own set of house rules for the pet, such as not allowing the pet on furniture or in certain areas of the house. You should make sure your pet follows these rules, even when your parents are not home. This way, your pet is not confused about the rules and is not encouraged to behave badly.


If you are unclear about the house rules for your pet, you can ask your parents to write them down for you and post them in an accessible area, such as on the fridge or by the front door. You can then refer to the rules if you are not sure if your pet is allowed to do certain things in your house.

, You should always let your parents deal with your pet when he behaves badly as you do not want to be aggressive with your pet on your own. Your pet may get annoyed and you are at a greater risk of injury than your parents if this happens.Instead, you should let your parents know when your pet is acting out or behaving badly and allow them to address it properly. As you get older, your parents may teach you how to address your pet's bad behavior in a positive and helpful way.

, You may notice that your pet seems ill and is displaying signs of a sickness or a health issue. Let your parents know right away if you notice anything, as they can then take your pet to the vet and get your pet examined.


It is important that you keep an eye on your pet and pay attention to your pet often, as this will ensure you notice any health issues before they become a larger problem. You may also discuss the symptoms of common illnesses with your parents so you know which signs to watch out for in your pet.

, As you grow up, your pet ownership duties may change. Your parents may feel you are mature enough to help them do other pet chores and tasks. You should try to take good care of your pet now so your parents feel they can trust you with more pet responsibilities in the future.Children over the age of 10 can usually assume many of the basic responsibilities of caring for a pet. Your parents may supervise you from afar but will likely allow you to complete many of the daily tasks required for good care of your pet.

Some do well when left alone for longer periods of time and others do not. Pets that are more social, have medical conditions, or that are used to having lots of interaction with others may not do as well on their own for long periods of time.Also consider your pet's feeding schedule or if your pet likes to get into things and make a mess when you are not around.
Younger pets may not be able to handle being left alone as well as more mature pets.
If your animal has separation anxiety, a pet-sitter or a boarding house may be a good option.;
, Two weeks before your vacation, start leaving your pet home alone for longer periods of time. If you usually leave your pet at home while you are away at work, leave your house for a couple of hours after work each day. If you usually see your pet during the day, leave your pet at home while you are at work.This will prepare your pet to spend more time alone.

, If you are leaving your pet in someone else's care, it is important that you give him or her enough information to care for your pet. Leave your contact information, the phone number of your veterinarian in case of an emergency. If your pet has any special dietary needs or likes specific treats or toys, write this information down. Include information about your pet's routine, bathroom habits, schedule, and any medications.Also include any information about your pet's personality that someone may need to know. Does your pet get excited when someone is at the door? Does your pet have a favorite hiding place?


Be as detailed as possible when writing down the instructions. It is better to give someone too much information than not enough.

, It is important that your pet is up-to-date on vaccinations and is healthy before you leave for vacation. This is also the time to ask about the best options for leaving your pet when you are gone. Your veterinarian may have recommendations for pet sitters and boarding options. Leaving your pet in a safe and trusted place will keep you from worrying while you are gone."

If you have a dog, he will probably be all over you within seconds of your arrival unless he's busy trying to dig out a bone from his favourite hidden place, your couch.


Calling out to your pets generates a positive attitude towards them and they feel less threatened. If you have a lot of pets, call out their names one after the other. Kittens usually do not respond if they are asleep, so you might need to respect that but they will scurry towards you if they suspect cat treats in the grocery bags you just bought in. Remind them that they were missed.;
, Even 20 minutes will help them feel taken care of. For more active pets, a walk might be a good idea
, If your cat has peed on your favourite luggage bag, wipe it clean. There is nothing much you can do about it, except try to take away the pungent smell from the luggage, beds or linen they tend to soil. The very best and most effective cleanser would be bicarbonate soda and/or a little white vinegar. You can try a solution of a little detergent mixed with bicarbonate soda: a few drops of bleach, a tablespoon of vinegar, 5 drops of Dettol, 2 tablespoons of bicarbonate soda and oodles of water. Cats cannot be screamed at, because they simply won't understand. They will know that you are angry for some reason and rubbing their snouts on the soiled area can repeat their behaviour. Carry your cats or kittens to the litter tray and be gentle with them. Soon they will learn.

, Dogs love to travel, but only if they get to ride shot-gun, so invest in a proper and spacey carrier box. Kittens like to sneak into dark corners within the car and this can be pretty hazardous if your kittens slip towards the food pedestals. Beware, invest in spacey and cosy carrier box.

See how long it takes you each day to properly care for all the animals you own. Compare this with the amount of free time you have available after other obligations are met, such as work, school, family time, etc. Make sure you won’t be neglecting another area of your life to care for all your animals.


Always remember to take care of your pets. If you don't have time to take care of them all or don't remember which ones you have taken care of that day, you may have to get rid of some of them.
Some animal types will require different maintenance. A long-haired dog, for example, probably needs to be brushed daily, while a cat can groom himself. Bird and hamster cages need to be cleaned out and disinfected often, with soiled bedding removed regularly. Be sure to consider the total amount of time you spend on all caretaking tasks for each animal you own each day, week, and month.
The amount of free time you have available and are willing to spend caring for pets will determine how much time you spend with them. However, if it takes over two to three hours to take care of all your animals every day, then you may already have too many pets.;
, Consider what your living arrangements are —how large is the living area and yard space you have for your animals? If you live in a small upstairs apartment without a yard, then take that into account when thinking about how many animals you can house. If you live out in the country on several acres, then you can probably keep more animals. Remember that each animal needs to have enough room to walk around and not be in a cramped space.


While space definitely needs to be considered so that everyone can live together comfortably, time is the more important factor here. If you have the time to walk your dogs, then providing a large area to run in is not as important as making sure you can take them for walks every day to meet their exercise needs.

, Your health status is an important factor to consider when getting more pets. Be aware of what you can and cannot handle without assistance. If you have difficulty getting around on your own, another pet may not be the best idea.


Also, consider your mental health status. Depression can make it very difficult to care for yourself as well as pets. Your animals rely on you, so not taking on more than you can handle is very important for everyone’s wellbeing.
Animals can cause stress and contribute to mental health problems, such as anxiety. You are responsible for your pets. The more animals you have, the more their needs, health issues and behavior can weigh on you.

, Though the number of pets you have can give you an idea of whether you already have a lot, the resources that you have available are more important than the actual number of animals you own.You need to be able to care for and provide an enriching environment for all your animals so that they can be happy and bring you joy as companions instead of more life stress.Consider what species of animals you have as well as individual temperaments and group sexual dynamics before getting another pet.


Overcrowding may have a negative effect on the pets you already have. For example, it's recognized that in household with five cats or more there is a high likelihood of inappropriate spraying in order to mark territory. This is because the cats view the presence of other cats as a threat. The more cats, the bigger the perceived threat. So consider whether or not it's fair to take on another pet if it adds to the stress of your existing pets.
If you can't count all your pets, or lose count, you have too many pets and shouldn’t get any more.
While some people may look down on a person with 10 cats, as long as the owner can provide a sanitary place to live, afford medical care and emergency services for each cat as well as meet their own needs and pay bills, then there isn’t a problem.
The pack mentality can increase as you get more dogs, and this can cause more behavioral problems because the social dynamics become more complex and your ability to give attention to each animal is lessened.Mixing male and female animals can increase competition. Hormones, territorial tendencies, and breeding behavior all contribute to problems you will have to deal with. Keep this in mind before adding new pets to the ones you already have.

, Write down your expected expenses and income for the month. Use bank statements, receipts, and bills to help determine what you’re spending every month. Include your house or rent payment, car payments, insurance, groceries, gas, utilities, and other spending. Be sure to include all the expenses related to your pets, such as food, grooming, toys, bedding, supplies, medications, and healthcare costs.


Doing this will allow you to see how much you are spending on your pets every month. Consider how adding another pet will change these numbers. Is it something you still want to do?

, Looking at the numbers, what could you afford if you didn’t have so many pets? Look at yearling savings as well as monthly. This can really show you whether another pet is worth it or not.


If you didn’t have pets, could you increase your entertainment costs or pay for a car? Could you take that trip you’ve been wanting to take? Now, think about the monthly and yearly costs associated with getting another pet. What will you have to cut out of your budget and lose?

, Don’t skip meals to pay for your cats’ litter. Make sure you get the nutrition you need and can pay your bills on time. If you’re regularly making late rent payments or not going to the doctor so you can buy your dogs’ food, then you probably don’t need another pet.

, Medical care for animals can be expensive — sometimes thousands of dollars a visit. You’ll want to be able to save up money regularly in case you need to pay for emergency care or buy prescription medications for your animals. You need to be financially prepared for each animal that you own.


Keep up to date with shots. Many young animals need a series of vaccinations the first year and regular rabies vaccinations after that.
If you have multiple animals, pet insurance may be a good option. Be sure you can make your payments every month and pay any remaining balances for each pet.

, Your apartment or neighborhood may have rules that dictate the size, breed, and number of animals you can have. Check your lease, talk to your landlord or your neighborhood association to find out if there is a limit to how many animals you can keep on your property.

, Your local animal control and zoning laws probably dictate how many animals you can keep on your property. Governing bodies do this in order to prevent unsanitary, unhealthy conditions for residents. You will want to call animal control or talk to your city or county administrative office to find out what the local laws are so you can remain in compliance.


Pet hoarding, or having too many pets than you can take care of, is likely in violation of your state, city, county, or other local health and zoning laws. You could lose your pets and even your house., Many cities and counties require animals to be registered and licensed. In order to license pets, the pet often has to be spayed or neutered (or a breeder license purchased) and all shots be up to date. You can be fined or jailed if you do not have all your pets legally licensed.

, Because you are responsible for your pets and your children, having too many pets can compromise your ability to care for your children. If you can’t keep your property and home clean or neglect your animals, you can be charged with child neglect or endangerment as well. Make sure your children are taken care of before you consider getting anymore pets.

, The more animals you have, the more odors and noise they create. Don’t get so many pets that your neighbors start complaining. The size of your residence will play a factor in this as well — an apartment is going to be right next to another apartment, whereas you probably have some space between houses.


Many apartments and cities have noise ordinances. Check with yours to make sure that adding another barking dog won’t be a problem.

, Some people have a mental illness that causes them to have more than the typical number of pets. They are unable to meet minimal care requirements and cannot recognize that they have a problem — even when animals become ill or die. You will need to contact your local police or health department or humane society if you or someone you know suffers from this condition.The unsanitary conditions of pet hoarding also negatively affect the community by increasing the risk of fire, creating poor air quality, attracting pests, and encouraging the transmission of infectious diseases. It is in your best interest to report suspected pet hoarding cases.
When animals do not have access to enough food, live in unhygienic conditions or don’t get medical care, it’s considered to be animal cruelty.
If you suspect you may be a pet hoarder, seek professional help right away.

, If you find that you can’t support the pets you have or take care of them, then you need to give up some of them. You and your animals all deserve to have a good quality of life. If you can no longer give them the attention, time, space, or provide the food or medical care that they need, you must allow them a chance to get the care they deserve with someone else.


Friends, family members, and co-workers might be able to take one off your hands. If not, there are many rescue groups, shelters, and animal sanctuaries that can help.
Put an add up in your local paper, at a local pet shop, feed store, or on an online site like craigslist.com for the animals you need to give up.

, If you can no longer take care of extra animals, you can still help out in other ways. Support documented 501(c)(3) corporations with a reputation for providing high-quality animal care however you can. Your local shelter can always use your help as well."

All pets require time, money, and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed. You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long-term.


Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so make sure you'll be home enough to take care of your pet.
If you have kids, consider what pets will be kid friendly. Hamsters and fish, for example, make great early pets.
If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldn't consider a pet until you are more stable. ;
, Even different types of dogs have different needs, so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means. Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:



Dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.

Cats - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out..

Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.

Fish - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.

Lizards - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.

Birds - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.

, Curious, food-driven, and unable to listen to your warnings, pets can get into trouble if you don't create boundaries or safe spaces. Birds may dart out of open windows, lizards can scamper around the house, and dogs or cats may run into the street. Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach.


Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food.
If you want your animal to have outside time, consider putting in a fence.
Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's ""bedroom.""
Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other.

, Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things you'll need -- housing, toys, grooming supplies, etc. -- and shop before you bring your new pet home. Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page.


If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by ""feeding"" a doll or regularly watering plants.

, Pets are not ultra expensive, but that doesn't mean you won't need to spend money. Below are some annual cost estimates provided by the ASPCA:



Dogs-- $600-$900, depending on size

Cats-- $600

Rabbit-- $700

Rodents--$300-$650, depending on size

Fish -- $40 Small Birds -- $400

Large Birds (Parrots, Macaws)-- $700-$1,200 Set aside a few hundred dollars in case of emergency veterinary costs.

, Be sure to bring your pet to the vet soon after adopting it as well. Just like humans, pets need regular check-ups to spot problems before they become serious conditions. Use your first visit to discuss how often you should schedule check-ups and your pet's dietary and medical needs.


Be sure to schedule shots and vaccinations as soon as you can.
Ask your vet what symptoms to look for if your pet gets sick.
Spay or neuter dogs and cats to prevent pet over-population. Record your vet's number as well as the number of a veterinary hospital in case of emergencies.

, The cheapest food you find may not always be the healthiest. Feeding animals table scraps - no matter how cute they are when they beg - is not a good idea since people food often has minerals and items in it that can be harmful to our animal friends. Only feed your pet appropriate foods and give them responsible portions.


Research or ask your vet about good food sources and portion sizes.
Natural foods, though more expensive, are healthier than dry or processed foods. , Though this is certainly true of dogs and cats, even fish and lizards require dedication and love to really thrive. Animals are social beings much like humans, and you need to set aside time to play with your pets so they get exercise and mental stimulation.


Give your pet room to roam -- the bigger the animal, the more room they'll need.
Buy toys and play-sets for you and your pet to use together.
Give your pet the occasional treat after good behavior to motivate it and cement good habits.

, This will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy. Create a regular cleaning schedule, at least once every 2-3 weeks, and stick to it, cleaning your animal and it's living spaces to prevent disease and odor.


For larger pets like cats and dogs, there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses.
Keep up with regular grooming, such as brushing fur or scrubbing scales, every few days.
For dogs and cats, make sure you keep their nails short so they don't break painfully. , While these steps are general guidelines for pet ownership, each animal is different and you need to adapt accordingly. Ask friends who have similar pets, check out books from the library, and search internet discussion boards about your breed or species. You can never know too much.


Be flexible once you bring your pet home. Pets have personalities and will have different wants and needs.

Different animals have different needs regarding care (for example, tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish), and even within the same species, different breeds can have different needs.


If you are buying a dog, then buying a high energy, large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day. Focus on the pet's needs, not your wants.If you want an animal like a snake instead, research is still important. It is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source (such as a lightbulb).
If you're leading an active life, choose a dog. If you are away from home a lot, though, choose a cat or some other free-roaming animal. If you just want an animal to look at and don't want to interact with it directly, or don't have lots of time, choose a fish or a snake, or other creepy-crawlies.;
, It’s a mistake to just decide “I want a dog” (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.


Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the ""herd,"" the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave.
It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter.
For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out.

, Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.


Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies. Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes.
Don’t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet. You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care. That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly.

, Figure out the exercise needs (if any) of the pet before you buy it, and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet them.Some pets don't require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about, such as buying a run for a rabbit, and making sure the tank is large enough for fish. But other pets must be exercised.
Dogs require a more hands-on approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly. Making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors.

, Many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals, making them ill when they consume them, so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat.


Overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding, so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra. For some animals, dietary requirements may change with the season; for example, if you have horses or other grazing animals, they will often require more hay during the seasons when there is less grass.
Look at pet food labels to make sure you are purchasing food for your pet that is properly nutritious. Research which food could harm your pet.
It is vital that all pets have a constant water supply. Check water bowls at least once a day to ensure that they have enough water and that the water is clean and not contaminated.

, Many animals will largely take care of themselves, only really needing to be groomed or bathed when they manage to get very messy. Others, such as long-haired dogs or cats, may need regular grooming.


It is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age. When brushing fur, ensure any brush used on the face is soft, and if brushing long, tangled fur, take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging. You can buy brushes for pets at pet stores.
When bathing your pet, make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction - buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary, but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals.
Consider taking your pet to a professional groomer if you aren’t sure you are competent to do it. You don’t want to accidentally injure the pet.

, As pets cannot tell us when they are ill or injured, it is up to us to keep an eye on them and look out for any signs of injury.


Knowing your pet's normal behavior is very important; if they are sick or injured, they will often act unusually, such as sleeping more, going off their food, etc. If they begin to act oddly, check them for any injuries and keep an eye on their food and water intake; if they stop eating or drinking, or they have obvious wounds that are concerning you, then take them to the vet.
Make sure that your pet has all of the proper vaccines and other preventative medication suggested by your veterinarian, such as heart worm pills for some dogs.

, A major part of caring for a pet is training. Training is essential for the safety of the animal and the people who interact with it.If you have an apartment cat, the litter box is very important from the start. You have to teach your cat to use the litter box and to think of it as its only place to do the necessary business.The litter box needs frequent cleaning (once or twice a day, depending on the cat).Feeding is approximately 2 or 3 times a day, again, depending on the cat. Water should be supplied continuously.
Dogs need to be trained so they understand proper behavior, such as where to go to the bathroom and not to jump on people when they enter the house. It’s important that the owner establishes control, but never in an abusive or harmful way to the animal.

, Some animals require more attention than others, so the amount of time they need is often relative. Just be sure than you are capable of fulfilling whatever that need may be.


Try to take a little time out of each day to spend with your pet, even if it's just sitting down with them. More often than not, your pet would be more than happy to relax with you.
Dogs should be walked, and hamsters need time to run around in their balls.Play should be fun for both your pet and you, but make sure it is safe and monitored at all times.
Research whether your pet breed needs to socialize with other animals. Play with it - dogs are very social animals so they need to spend time with their owners. With toys or simply chasing him around is enough for exercising. Dogs have a natural craving for chewing things, so buy a chewing toy to keep him entertained.

, Love is what your relationship with your pet has to be about. Show him or her your affection by petting and playing.


Your pet will be a member of your family, so treat it like one. A good cuddle will do the both of you good. Pets respond to the tone of people's voices as well as touch.
Horses need attention. Like wild horses, if you don't love them properly, they pretty much turn into mustang. Give them a treat once in a while, take a walk with them, or ride them for fun.
Train a pet with positive reinforcement, never cruelty or abuse.Keep your pet and its environment clean.
If you have a small animal, clean their cage weekly. You're not showing your pet love if you let it sit in filth. If you have a dog, vacuum fur regularly from the house and wash their dog bed from time to time. Neglecting to clean your pet could result in infection, so keep on top of its cleanliness!

Just like you, they want freedom, good food, entertainment and may have acute feelings like sorrow, happiness etc. A pet may not be a human but it's feelings and needs are very similar. They may not be able to express their feelings to us but they feel just like us and they enjoy and suffer, just like you and me.;
,, It is your duty and responsibility to see that they don't feel as if they are different or that they suffer from loneliness or sorrow. You must take and treat them as a family member, loving and caring for them as if it was brother, sister, son or daughter.

, Read and learn about your pet. This way you will be able to understand his or her needs. Try to understand his or her body language. Spending more time with him or her will strengthen your relationship and allow you to understand your pet better. A pet who is comfortable in new surroundings will not be active and may be defensive/aggressive. These pets are ideal for families or the elderly. On the other hand, curious and active personalities are not submissive and are ideal for families without children below 10 years old.

, Unless your pet will be alone for a long period pf time, examples would be for an entire day or a few days at length.

Finally, have overall common sense!",How to Take Care of Outdoor Exotic Animals," Not only do you need to make a nice living space for your animals before you even get them; but you need to follow and, most often, exceed local or federal laws about minimally required spaces for each species.


Depending on the type of exotic pet, find an empty pasture or clear a space on your property that's about one acre long. Fence the area and remove any hazardous items. Buy or make a gate for the front of the pasture. Then build a shelter for them to sleep and escape from rain, hail, snow and other adverse weather conditions. Make sure it's the right height, especially for a llama! a good house for an exotic animal is about 10 feet (3.0 m) by ten feet. Several animals can fit in it! It's easier to make it a three-sided house so you don't have to mess with a door.;
, This includes a place to store the food, like a new metal trash can, something to carry the food in, like a pitcher, and a hay feeders with several areas for eating with trays underneath to put the food in. You can make one yourself or buy one at a farm store.

, Buy a padlock and secure the gate on the pasture. Always keep the key in the same place, and check the lock after each time you feed the animals.

, Make sure it doesn't have any cracks or holes in it, rinse it out with a hose, and watch your animals sip their drinks! These should be emptied of contaminated water away from feeding areas, scrubbed clean all over with a small amount of bleach and a stiff brush, rinsed until you can no longer taste or smell any trace of bleach or fecal matter whatsoever, and refilled with clean, pure water.

, Clean the droppings out of the pasture, animal housing, common areas and, especially, feeding areas daily with a rake and snow shovel, dumping it into a wheelbarrow. Then rinse any wooden or paved areas with water and squeegee the area dry. Don't make your animal(s) sleep or live on wet floors no matter what the season. Clear away all food left out the previous day from all areas before putting out fresh food and water. Carefully clean all water containers that might have gotten droppings, food, or other contamination in them.

, Pet them every day and give them hugs and kisses. Gently brush their fur and feed them out of your hand. Make sure your animal(s) have lots of safe, interesting toys and other enrichment like new things to smell or play with everyday. Don't leave enrichment with an animal for more than 3 -4 days at a time and clean all toys, etc. thoroughly with a small amount of bleach, lots of water, and a stiff brush before storing it or giving it to any other animal. Caring for exotic animals of any species is very hard work but, when done with dedication and love can be a great experience for you and your animals.

You could also have your pet stay at the friend's or neighbor's house.
If you are taking your pet to someone else's home, bring something from your home that will make your pet feel comfortable (e.g. bed, blanket, favorite toy).

, You can make arrangements to take your dog to a kennel. Make sure the kennel is certified by the International Boarding & Pet Services Association (IBPSA). Other questions you should ask the kennel include: the staff-to-pet ratio, clean and secure facility, climate controlled, frequency of exercise for the animals, grooming options, where will your pet be housed (e.g. individual crate or suite), and how much interaction your pet will have with other animals.Dogs do well at kennels because they are social animals.
It's best to visit the kennel before you make arrangements for your pet to stay there. You want to be comfortable with wherever your pet is staying.
Leave your contact information and your veterinarian's contact information with people at the kennel.

, Some individuals will offer boarding for a small number of animals in their home. This is good for animals who like to socialize and be with other animals. This setting is more intimate than a traditional boarding kennel. Ask your veterinarian for a referral.Evaluate the in-home boarding place the same way you would evaluate any other boarding kennel.

If your pet is used to being in a quiet home with only adults, find a place that mimics that.The relocation environment is extremely important. Your pet can become disoriented and possibly sick from sudden lifestyle changes.

, Birds and cats enjoy being in consistent, familiar environments. Birds may become restless and pluck their own feathers in unfamiliar environments. Similarly, cats can become distressed in different environments. It's best to find a sitter to stay in your home or stop by your home every day.


If you have a bird, make sure that the sitter is comfortable and knowledgeable about birds.
Cats should not be left alone at someone else's home. They are likely to wander, escape, and try to return home.

, A kennel should be the last resort for this type of pet. Make sure the kennel you choose caters to your pet. If your pet will be at a kennel that also houses dogs and cats, it is best if it will be housed in a separate area. Always check out the kennel before you allow your pet to stay there.

Start young and stay calm.,
Repeat, and repeat again.",How to Train a Parrot," Think about how you would want to teach a small child. If they feel safe, calm, comfortable, and alert, they are more likely to take instruction effectively. The same is true for your parrot.


Find a quiet space where you and your avian student can focus on the task at hand. Choose somewhere familiar to the bird so it will already have a level of comfort before training starts.Don’t try to train when the parrot is overly agitated. Wait for a calmer moment. However, training with treats works best when the bird is hungry, so training before mealtime is usually the best scenario.;
, While parrots are often quite friendly and caring, they are not in general known for being overly patient. Delays and mistakes during training sessions may not go over well, so preparation beforehand is important.


Gather up the supplies you will need for they type of training you will be conducting. These might include items like a hand-held perch, a towel, a clicker (if “clicker training”), a chopstick or drumstick (if “target training”), a leash/harness (if taking training outdoors), bitter apple spray (to make common areas of parrot nibbling like draperies unappealing), and, of course, treats.Choose a treat that your parrot especially enjoys, and also that you can easily feed to your bird. Thin apple wedges, for example, can make a good hand treat for a parrot., We’ve all heard that old dogs have trouble learning new tricks, and the same principle holds true for just about any animal, including parrots (and people, for that matter!).


Begin the process of training your bird as soon as possible. So long as your parrot has reached the point of being capable (if not yet entirely willing) to eat a treat from your hand, you can begin training.Hold multiple training sessions during the day, ideally at similar times each day for consistency, but more importantly when the parrot is in the mood for learning (that is, calm).
However, keep the sessions relatively short — no longer than fifteen minutes at a time. Once your bird begins to lose interest, it is best to end the session and begin again another time., Rewarding your bird with a treat from your hand is essential to practically every type of parrot training out there. It also helps establish a bond between you and a new and/or young parrot.Start the process with the parrot inside its cage. Slowly approach and present the treat. Stay calm and offer only encouraging approval when the bird eventually takes the treat.
Apple slices, again, make a good treat option if you’re worried about having your fingers nibbled upon. You can also wear gloves, if you so choose, though your bird may find those even more appealing to peck at.

, “Shaping” is a training ideology that focuses upon rewarding the bird for approximations, and eventually deliberate acting, of the steps required to complete a training task.Shaping is well-named, for it is all about molding behaviors through positive reinforcement.
As one example, if you were teaching your parrot to bathe itself in a small water dish, you would reward the bird for (among several other intermediary steps) looking toward the dish, looking at the dish, moving toward the dish, moving to the dish, testing the water, stepping into the water, and eventually splashing around.

, Pets ranging from birds to cats can often benefit from “clicker training,” which involves using a hand-held clicking device (think of the sound a pen clicker or metal juice-bottle cap makes) to indicate proper behavior worthy of a reward.The “click” serves as an audible cue that an appropriate response has occurred, and should occur immediately upon said response and be accompanied immediately by a reward. Thus, you may hear the phrase “click and treat” to describe what is essentially a single maneuver.
For instance, if using a clicker during “step up training” — as detailed elsewhere in this article — the “click and treat” would occur immediately upon the parrot stepping up onto your finger/hand. Clicking can be incorporated into virtually any training program.

, Another training option, which can be used in combination with a clicker if desired, is known as “target training.” It uses a bird’s natural curiosity in investigating new objects to build a reliable response.In a basic version of target training, a chopstick, drumstick, or other wooden wand is pointed in the vicinity of the parrot, and any contact with the tip is immediately rewarded with a treat (or “click and treat,” if desired). Slowly, over time, the parrot will learn to follow the target throughout the cage and around the room, in the process learning to obey a simple command prompt.Target training builds a key basic skill, therefore, that serves as a gateway to more specific training.

, As the name indicates, this skill involves your bird learning to step or hop from one perch to another as directed, with the target perch usually your hand, finger, or hand-held perch (such as a dowel rod).


The step up is an ideal skill to teach early on for several reasons:It is relatively easy to master for both teacher and student.
It derives from a natural parrot behavior, the desire to move from perch to perch.
It is practical, as having your bird hop into your hand on command makes everything from playtime to cage-cleaning easier.
It leads into other, more detailed skills as a basic maneuver.


While the step up is a simple skill, there are numerous training methods of varying complexity from which to choose, a few of which are described in the following steps.

, If your new bird has some prior training experience or just a natural inclination, the simplest training option may be sufficient.Offer your finger or wrist to your parrot (depending on the bird’s size and your preference), placing it in front of the bird at mid-breast level. Many birds will naturally step up onto the new perch without any coaching at all.
Create a cue for the behavior, either by saying “step up” or employing a clicker simultaneous to the parrot making its move. Reward the bird immediately as well.
If the bird does not step up unprompted, employ “shaping” and reward incremental behaviors, such as touching the perch with the beak, placing one foot on the perch, etc.

, In this method, you use the treat more as a lure to coax the desired behavior, but the basic training principles are quite similar.Hold the treat in one hand, and offer the other hand/finger to the bird at chest level. Orient your hands so that the easiest way for the parrot to reach the treat is by stepping up onto the offered perch.
If your bird does not immediately step up, reward any contact with the offered perch at first, and incrementally reward only the desired step-up behavior.
If you’re handy enough with the clicker to use it while both hands are occupied, it can be incorporated, and/or a verbal cue like saying “step up.”

, If other methods have been less successful, or you have been utilizing target training already, you can teach the step-up by employing the familiar target and reward system.Hold your familiar target — a wooden drumstick, for instance — in one hand, and your desired perch (your finger, hand, or hand-held perch) in the other. Alternatively, if your manual dexterity is up to the task, you can do both with one hand, which leaves the other for holding treats, a clicker, etc.
Locate the target so that it directs the bird to the new perch, which should be located in the common step-up position at the bird’s chest.
Immediately reward positive behavior, and use the clicker or a verbal cue if desired. Eventually, the target will no longer be required to prompt the behavior.

, Especially for people new to parrot ownership, talking is usually the first skill they think of teaching and of which they presume their bird will be able to master.


The truth of the matter is, every parrot is different, and you should never acquire a bird — even of a breed known for talking — with the assumption that it will talk., Some parrots will require little or no training to learn to talk, and may in fact pick up words and phrases you’d prefer they not repeat.


Excited utterances — such as things you might shout at the TV during a sporting event — are often more readily picked up by a parrot, and they’re listening more often than you may think. So be careful what you say around them!, Parrots talk to other members of their flock, and it is easier to establish yourself as part of your bird's flock early in its life. Therefore, you are more likely to have success when starting with a baby bird.Use a clear, calm, happy voice to repeat a simple word or phrase as you start the training process. Think about how you would try to teach a human child to say ""Mommy.""
Early in the process, reward any sound, then any approximately accurate sound, and eventually a recognizable sound with an immediate treat.

, Repetition is the key element of training a parrot to talk. Simply put, the more times you say a word or phrase around a parrot, the more likely it is to pick it up and repeat it.


Train as often as you like. Parrots will not tire of conversing with another member of their flock, although you may.
Some experts recommend recording yourself saying a phrase and playing it back on a loop for the bird.Of course, by using this method you lose the personal interaction between the two of you.

You should also take note of how often it uses the bathroom. This way, you will know when to and how often to carry your bird to the bathroom area.Most parrots will squat down slightly and flick their tails up when they're ready to go to the bathroom. Watch your bird to see what precise movements it makes when it's getting ready to go.
Also, keep track of how often your bird defecates. Parrots can defecate as often as every 15 minutes. This way, you'll know roughly how often you'll need to direct your bird to the bathroom area.;
, You want a command to reinforce the behavior. You want to be able to say something when you see your bird squatting that will alert it that it needs to go to the bathroom area. Pick something simple, like ""Go potty"" to teach your bird where to use the bathroom., You should have an area in your parrot's cage where it can go to the bathroom. Most people use something like a waste basket or lay down paper towels or newspaper in a certain portion of their home. You can also use paper plates. Make sure you pick a space the bird can easily access on its own., Watch your bird when it's out of its cage. Remember the natural behaviors you noticed that indicated the bird needed to use the bathroom. If you see the bird doing things that indicates it needs to go, like squatting or flicking its tail, immediately move the bird to the bathroom area.At first, you will need to use the ""step up"" command to get your bird to climb on your arm or finger. Then, take your bird to the potty spot and hold it over the spot until it goes to the bathroom., Watch your bird closely. When it defecates, say your command. This will help your bird make the connection. It will realize it's supposed to go to the bathroom in the bathroom area.Some people use commands like ""Hurry up"" if their bird is taking a while to relieve itself. For example, if your bird has been standing on the potty area for a while, you can say something like ""Hurry up!"" and reward your bird as soon as it goes to the bathroom.

, Each time the bird goes in the bathroom spot, give it a reward. Parrots respond best to positive reinforcement. Offer a treat and praise when the bird successfully goes to the bathroom in the right spot. Choose a specific treat your parrot only gets for using the bathroom so the parrot understands what it's being rewarded for.You can also reward your bird by letting it out of the cage for a few minutes each time it goes to the bathroom in the proper spot. Then, put it back in its cage until it goes to the bathroom in the right spot again.

, Watch your bird closely both inside and outside of its cage. As soon as your bird begins squatting, take it to the potty spot. Do this for a few weeks until your bird knows where to relieve itself. Always say the command and reward your bird for going in the right spot.Be patient. It can be time consuming to be moving the bird to the bathroom area every 10 to 15 minutes, but most birds will eventually learn the behavior.

, If you just got a parrot, it will need time to adjust to your home. Potty training, or any kind of training, can be overwhelming if done too early. Spend some time letting your bird adjust. Once your bird is calm and friendly with you, you can begin training.How long your bird needs to relax depends on the temperament of the bird. Some birds come around right away while others need a lot of time.

, You cannot expect a bird to learn right away. It will take time and consistency for your parrot to be toilet trained. Even then, you can expect some occasional accidents. Keep these expectations in mind so you do not get angry or frustrated while training your parrot., Scolding or striking your parrot will not result in it learning faster. In fact, this will only stress out your bird. High levels of stress can cause behavioral problems. Even if your bird is not behaving how you want, you should never hit or scold it."

The color is white or another very light color. Bees feel threatened by darker colors, which remind them of bears.
The fit is loose. Choose a size or two larger than what you normally wear, rather than getting a shirt that's skin tight. That way if a bee inserts its stinger into the fabric, it won't be right against your skin.;
, You'll need to make a few alterations along the collar, sleeves and opening in order to create a tight seal that will keep bees from crawling in. It helps to have a sewing machine, but if you don't have one, you can certainly make the alterations by hand. Here's what you need:A roll of one-inch wide white velcro. Stick-on velcro works fine, or you can get the type that doesn't have adhesive backing. You need enough to line the shirt opening, the collar and the sleeve openings, so you may want to take measurements before purchasing velcro.
A needle and white thread (or a sewing machine, if you have one).
A measuring tape and scissors.

, Use a small pair of scissors to snip off all the buttons. Take care to snip the threads just underneath the buttons without cutting a hole in the shirt. Snip the buttons from the opening of the shirt, the collar and the sleeve openings., Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread. Insert the needle from inside the shirt near the edge of a buttonhole. Stitch the buttonhole tightly closed, then finish it off by tying another tight knot. Repeat until you've sewn every buttonhole closed, including those around the collar and sleeve openings.


You might want to double-thread the needle if you're working with thin or weak thread.
Neat, invisible stitching is not the goal: just make sure the buttonholes are tightly closed and won't pop open when you're handling bees.

, Measure the length of the shirt opening. Place the measuring tape along the edge of the shirt's opening. Measure the length of the opening from the tip of the shirttail to the bottom of the collar. Write down the measurement, then use it to cut two pieces of velcro that will stretch the entire length of the shirt opening on both sides.

, Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces. Sew a piece of velcro over the length of the opening where you cut off the buttons. Sew another piece of velcro along the underside of the opening where you sewed up the buttonholes. The two pieces of velcro should seal firmly together when you close the shirt.


If you have a sewing machine, you can quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place. Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down. You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle.
If you're sewing by hand, make tight, neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while you're wearing your bee suit.

, Use the measuring tape to measure around the collar. Cut a length of velcro according to your measurement, and sew it around the inside of the collar. Cut a second length and sew it around the outside of the collar. This will allow you to adjust the collar to make it tight enough to keep bees out. Use the same method to add velcro to the sleeve openings.


Again, a sewing machine makes it easy to quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place. Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down. You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle.
If you're sewing by hand, make tight, neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while you're wearing your bee suit.

, A cowboy-style hat with a wide brim makes the perfect base for your beekeeping hat. It will keep the veil from touching your face as you work, making it easier to see and less likely that a bee will get close enough to your skin to sting. Look for a hat with these qualities:The fabric is thick enough to keep out bees, but thin enough to pierce with a sewing needle. Felt and tightly-woven straw hats work well; leather can be too thick.
The hat is lightweight enough that you won't overheat. You'll be doing most of your beekeeping in the summer, so keep that in mind when you choose your hate.
The brim is stiff, not floppy. It should be firm enough to keep the veil several inches from your face.

, You can use stiff nylon mesh, tulle, or wire mesh to make the veil. You need enough veil fabric to fit around the brim of the hat and fall at least five inches below your shoulders. One yard should be sufficient.


Be sure to use a clear or white fabric so that you'll be able to see through it easily.
If you find a thin tulle you want to use, you may need a double layer to make sure your veil keeps the bees away.

, Measure around the brim of the hat, then cut your fabric about an inch wider. You'll need a bit of overlap to make sure the bees can't get through the seam. Make sure the fabric is long enough to drape down five inches below your shoulders.

, Overlap the edges by half an inch. Stitch the edges closed to create a large tube of fabric with the same circumference as your hat's brim. Make sure the tube is sturdy enough to keep out bees before moving to the next step. It doesn't hurt to add an extra row of stitches along the seam.

, Working by hand, carefully sew the top edge of the veil around the brim of the hat. If you are hand-sewing, be sure to use small whip-stitches to keep all openings too small for the bees to enter and get underneath the mesh. Continue until the veil is tightly secured to the hat.

, Your bee-tight shirt and hat are the most important parts, but in order for your suit to work, you'll need a few more items. Remember that everything should be white or light in color:Thick white sweatpants or work pants. Make sure they have tight elastic around the waist and ankles. You can also wear white workout pants if sweatpants are too hot.
Tall socks.
Thick gloves. Dishwashing gloves work just fine. Some beekeepers prefer to be bare-handed.
Sturdy work boots. Look for boots that are ankle or calf length and made of leather or other durable material. There should be enough room around the opening of the boot so you can tuck the bottom of the pants into them.

, Set the hat on your head and drape the veil down over your shoulders, bunching it around your neck. Pull up the gloves so that they cover your hands and wrists.

, Put it on so that the end of the veil is tucked under the shirt. Secure the shirt opening by pressing the velcro closed. Secure the velcro around the collar and sleeve openings. Check to make sure there are no gaps.

, Make sure the elastic on your pants is tight around the bottom of your shirt.

, Pull the elastic at the bottom of your pants over your socks. Put on your shoes, and tuck the bottom of your pants into your shoes before tying them. You are now ready to handle bees.

, This option is more expensive than making a suit out of a shirt and pants, but some find it easier to have a one-piece suit. make sure the coverall you purchase is white or light in color.


Dark colors can aggravate bees since these colors remind them of their predators, like bears and skunks.
Make sure the coverall fits loosely in order to keep the material from directly contacting the skin. This helps to avoid stingers that might pierce the fabric.

, Measure elastic to fit the neck hole and wrists, then cut the elastic to the correct measurements. Sew the elastic pieces around neck opening and wrist openings.


This is important to prevent bees from gaining access to the inside of the coverall.
Don't make the elastic too tight, but it should be tight enough to offer protection from bees.

, When putting on the beekeeper's suit, put the hat on first, then the coveralls. Make sure the mesh of the hat is securely tucked in at the neck of the coveralls. Add gloves, socks and boots to the ensemble.

Look for a bee larger than the others in the hive.,
Look for a bee with a pointed abdomen.,
Using a magnifying glass, look for a bee without a barb on its stinger.,
Look for a bee that stands with its legs splayed apart.,
Watch the way the other bees act subserviently around her.",How to Identify a Queen Bee," The easiest way to tell the queen bee apart from other bees is by her size. Queens mated with drones are the largest bees in the hive, both longer and wider than other bees, while queens who have yet to mate, or virgin queens, are smaller than mated queens but larger than either worker bees or drones.


The queen bee's larger size, as well as her ability to lay eggs, is due to eating protein-rich royal jelly, which is secreted from glands on the heads of young worker bees and mixed with pollen to form a whitish milk or mush. All bees are fed royal jelly for the first few days after hatching, but only queen bees are fed royal jelly until reaching physical maturity. Royal jelly not only enables queen bees to mature sexually, it also enables them to reach physical maturity sooner (after 16 days as opposed to 21 days for worker bees) and contributes to their extended lifespan.
Virgin queens are reared in the event the mated queen becomes old or incapacitated. They are kept separate from the mated queen and each other; if 1 virgin queen encounters another, she will attack and attempt to kill it.;
, A queen bee's larger abdomen is noticeably more pointed than the abdomens of either worker or drone bees.

, Worker bees' stingers are barbed; once they sting a target, the barb catches and pulls the stinger from their abdomen, killing the worker. Queen bees, however, have no barbs on their stingers, enabling them to sting a target repeatedly.

, Necessary because of her greater size, keeping her legs splayed apart, like those of the bug in the game of Cootie, enables the queen bee to move quickly through the hive.

, As long as the queen bee is healthy and productive, worker bees are notably deferential to her, getting out of her way when she moves forward and standing at attention facing her when she stops.

Make sure the horse is aware of your presence by gently patting it on the rump. To get your horse to lift her foot, run your hand down her leg. Then, squeeze the tendon above the ankle and lift the hoof. The horse should shift its weight to its other three feet.While you work, hold the foot in place by tucking your hip against the horse's hock (the large joint on the hind leg) and gaskin (the muscle above the hock). Use the inside of your knee to pull the foot out slightly and up between your legs so that the sole of the hoof faces up towards you. Support the horse's toe with one hand. This position locks the horse's foot in place, making it difficult for the horse to kick or put its foot on the ground before you're done working.
Make sure that you reward your horse with praise for cooperating and waiting while you clean her hooves. Saying, “good girl” or “yes” after she lifts each hoof for you will help to reinforce your horse’s good behavior.;
, To remove a horseshoe, first, ""break"" (straighten) the nail clinches (the bent tips of each nail that holds the shoe on) with a clinch cutter and a hammer. Work the blade of the clinch cutter under the clinch, then hit it with a hammer to straighten the nail. Then, use a pair of metal pull-offs to loosen and remove the shoe. Close the jaws of the pull-offs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion, working towards the toe to loosen the shoe. Repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled off.Several alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches. In a pinch, you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards, or, if you're careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall, you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away.

, For your horse's health and safety, you don't want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot. Before shoeing your horse, use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt, mud, rocks, manure, etc. from your horse’s foot. Use downward strokes from heel to toe. Follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanliness.Take care around the frog - the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof. This part of the hoof is extra-sensitive.

, Typically, before a horse is shod, the dark, hard, outer layer of each hoof's sole is removed to reveal the softer, whiter material underneath in a process roughly equivalent to trimming a human's toenails. Take care not to cut too deep, or you risk hurting the horse or even rendering it temporarily lame - the same as if you'd cut a person's nails too short.This process is easiest if you keep your hoof knife razor sharp. But use caution. It's easy to accidentally slip and cut yourself while working.

, The hoof wall - the edge of the hoof - should extend about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 3 & 3/4 inches from the hairline above the hoof itself. If it's any longer, use a set of nippers (essentially giant nail clippers) to trim the edge of the hoof to a suitable length.You should see a ridge where the hoof wall extends beyond the sole. Do not cut into the sole with the nippers, or you may injure the horse.When you trim the hoof with nippers, be sure to keep the trimmed edges of the hoof uniformly straight and level so that they'll sit flush with the ground. Trim from each side of the heel to the toe.

The exception to this is in cases where a horse's gait wears its hoof unevenly - in this case, you'll want to take slightly less hoof material off of the side that the horse favors. Use caution when making this distinction and, if unsure, consult an experienced farrier.



, The very last thing that must be done to prepare the hoof for its shoe is to ensure the bottom of the hoof is smooth, flat and level. Use a rasp to gently file any uneven spots on the bottom of the hoof, taking care, as always, not to wear the hoof too short or irritate the frog. Then using your knife, pare away slightly to bevel the sole away from the hoof wall. Contact of the sole on the shoe can cause the horse discomfort., As with human feet, horse feet come in many different sizes and, thus, different horses will require different-sized shoes. Before proceeding, ensure that the shoes you have available are the correct size for your horse's feet. Note that a horse's front and hind feet are differently-shaped, so you will need different shoes for each.most horses have a size smaller in the back then the front, but not always.


If you have to choose between shoes that are slightly too big and shoes that are slightly too small, choose the bigger shoes. These can be bent, shaped, and ground down to a smaller size, while too-small shoes can't be made bigger. Too long a shoe in front will cause the horse to step on the exposed heel of the shoe and pull it off.

, Often, even if horse shoes are the correct size, they will not fit a horse's foot without adjustments. Like human feet, horse feet can be asymmetrical or uneven. There are several ways to custom-shape horseshoes.


If you're a knowledgeable metalworker, you can heat the shoe until the steel can be bent to the size of the hoof.
Or, you can cold shape the shoe on an anvil using a hammer and tongs.
Some farriers do neither, opting instead to grind their shoes down until they fit with a rasp or grinding machine.

Well-fitting horse shoes should align well with the edge of the hoof. Keep in mind that it may take some time to get a shoe to the perfect size for your horse.



, Align the shoe so that it sits perfectly against the edge of the hoof, then drive nails through the holes in the shoe to fix it to the horse's foot. When doing this, care must be taken so as not to hurt or hobble the horse.


Drive the nail through the hoof at an outward angle so that the nail tips go through the top of the hoof wall.

Never drive nails into the sensitive inner portion of the hoof. To make this easier, use hoof nails that have a bevel on one side to guide the tip through the hoof wall.With these special nails, the manufacturer's stamp on the side of the nail head should face the center of the foot (towards the frog) - this ensures that the bevel is facing the right direction.
Some modern horseshoes use glue, rather than nails, to hold the shoe in place.If you're worried about hurting your horse, you may want to try this alternative. Note that application methods for glue-on shoes can vary - consult the manufacturer or an experienced farrier for more information.

, Once each nail has been driven, use the claw end of your hammer to bend the tip of the nail over against the hoof wall. Then, twist off the tip or use a pair of nippers to bend and clip the tips off. Try leave about 1/8"" of the tip bent over the edge of the hole formed by the nail pointing towards the toe. This ensures that the nail will hold the shoe in place without the sharp tip hurting you or the horse.

, Set a clinch block under the nail on the outer hoof wall, then set the nail in the hoof (or ""clinch"" it) by hitting the nail head once again with the driving hammer. This gives the nail a firm grip in the horse's hoof, ensuring the shoe stays in place. You may use a sturdy metal tool, like your nippers, in place of the clinch block in a pinch.


Another option is to use a special tool called a clincher. With this tool, all you need to do is align the jaws of the clincher over the nail tip and squeeze the handles.

, Finally, give the outside of the hoof a once-over with a rasp, smoothing out any uneven spots and giving the hoof a nice clean finish. Pay special attention to the clinched nail tips, which can also be filed smooth.When finished, you should be able to draw a cloth over the hoof wall without it catching.


You may also notice that excess hoof material protrudes over the edge of the shoe. If this is the case, use a pair of nippers or pull-offs to remove it.

, Remember that the front and back hooves will require differently-shaped shoes and that even the two front and back feet may not be perfectly symmetrical with each other.

If not, a top bar hive that weighs less than 10 pounds may be best for you.
How many hives do I want? If you only want a couple of hives, a top bar or Warre hive are good options for you. If you want many hives, the Langstroth is a good choice for you.

You live in an area that does not go/rarely goes below 18 degrees Celsius, even in winter. This is because the bees will not be able to fly and collect resources, and so they need the stored food. It is probably not a good idea to harvest the honey if you live in Sydney.

An allergist can help you determine whether or not your guinea pig is the problem and advise you on how to limit/avoid exposure and treat your symptoms.Allergists treat both allergies and asthma (especially asthma induced by an allergic reaction).
Your allergist will most likely conduct a round of tests, which may include skin exposure tests, to confirm that guinea pigs are the source of your allergies.
See an allergist right away if you experience prolonged allergy symptoms, coughing/wheezing, shortness of breath, or any other quality of life issues associated with a suspected allergy.
In rare cases, extreme allergies may cause anaphylaxis, a potentially fatal reaction. If you experience vomiting, diarrhea, a sudden drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, a swollen tongue or throat, loss of consciousness, or severe hives or skin redness, go to an emergency room immediately.;
, Antihistamines are one of the most commonly-taken allergy medications. They are available over the counter or by prescription, and they come in tablet, syrup, or nasal spray forms.Antihistamines reduce your body's immune system response to allergens.
An antihistamine can help reduce itchy skin, sneezing, and runny nose.
Common over-the-counter tablets include fexofenadine (Allegra), loratadine (Claritin, Alavert) and cetirizine (Zyrtec).
Common prescription tablets include levocetirizine (Xyzal) and desloratadine (Clarinex).
Frequently-prescribed nasal sprays include azelastine (Astelin and Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase).

, Decongestants reduce nasal swelling/inflammation, which can make it easier to breathe if you're experiencing sneezing or stuffy nose. They are often sold as nasal sprays, and can typically be acquired without a prescription.Some over-the-counter allergy medications pair antihistamines and decongestants together in one oral tablet.
Decongestants aren't for everyone. They can have serious negative side effects for some individuals, including elevated blood pressure.
If you currently have high blood pressure, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, or an enlarged prostate, do not take decongestants unless your doctor has told you it is safe to do so.

, Corticosteroid nasal sprays are inserted into the nostril, sprayed, and inhaled. This class of medicine is typically administered in low doses and tend to have far fewer side effects than oral corticosteroids.Common nasal sprays that are available without a prescription include fluticasone (Flonase), mometasone furoate (Nasonex), and triamcinolone (Nasacort AQ).
If over-the-counter nasal sprays aren't enough, ask your doctor whether prescription-strength corticosteroids might help your symptoms.

, If you're experiencing an allergic reaction to guinea pigs in your home, you may find it helpful to use an air filter or purifier.These products help remove allergens from the air, reducing respiratory problems and potentially reducing contact of airborne particles with your skin.


If you purchase an air filter/purifier, make sure you use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and air purifiers.
HEPA filters and purifiers have been shown to reduce airborne allergens in some environments.

, If you or a family member are experiencing guinea pig allergies, make sure your guinea pig is not permitted to roam freely around the house. This can help limit or even eliminate exposure to the allergens, which may make it easier to live with a guinea pig in the home for some individuals.Keep your guinea pig's cage in a designated area that can be avoided. Do not put it in common areas like the living room or kitchen, or in/near your bedroom.
The room where you keep your guinea pig should ideally be uncarpeted for ease of cleaning. Wood, tile, linoleum, or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would.

, If you're allergic to guinea pigs, it's important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animal's saliva and urine. However, that protein can be transferred to the guinea pig's coat or skin during grooming or passing waste, and may be transferred to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding. Therefore, the urine, saliva, hair, and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposure.Exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately, or after numerous days, weeks, months, or even years of exposure.
If you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason, make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens. If contact cannot be avoided, make sure you take protective measures.

, Protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions. Protective equipment may not be enough, though, and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safety.Wearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthma-like symptoms, if you've experienced those symptoms in the past.
Gloves and long-sleeved shirts can help reduce your skin contact with guinea pigs, especially while handling the animals themselves or cleaning their cages.
Do not wear the long-sleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless it's been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding.

, Any time you've handled a guinea pig, cleaned its enclosure, or handled any materials from inside that enclosure, make sure you wash your hands as soon as possible.It's important to follow proper hand-washing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reaction.Get your hands wet under the faucet with clean, running water. The temperature doesn't really matter, since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs.
Apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather.
Work the soap between your hands, between your fingers, on the backs of your hands, and under your fingernails. Apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens (wrists and arms, for example).
Scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds. A common way to keep time is by singing or humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice in a row while you scrub your skin.
If you've been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig, wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound.
Rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap, which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with.
Use a clean, dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry. Discard the paper towel when you are finished.

, Depending on your situation, you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you. Ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilities.If you work at a pet store, let your supervisors know that you've experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling, feeding, or cleaning them.
If your guinea pig is a pet at home, ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties. If you can't find anyone willing to do this, you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies won't be a problem.

, Though it's always difficult to part with a pet, you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe. Talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig. You should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyer/adopter and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience.

, If you're experiencing allergies around a guinea pig, there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions. An allergist can help you identify whether you're allergic to some environmental factor, like hay/straw used for the animal's bedding.Hay and straw often cause asthma-like reactions, including difficulty breathing, increased production of mucus, and congestion in the chest.Many people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with hay/straw.Dermatitis is usually characterized by red, itchy, or inflamed skin. It may look like a rash on the skin, usually at the point of exposure., Some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding. Talk to an allergist, or try out a different bedding material that's free from any potential allergens.Even if wood shavings themselves aren't the problem, many people experience allergies to the various coloring, fragrances, and oils added to guinea pig bedding.
Eucalyptus oil and Manuka oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding.
Make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives, or try a different bedding material altogether.

, If bedding isn't the issue, there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food you're feeding your guinea pig. Handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be what's causing your reaction, though only an allergist can confirm this for sure.Artificial coloring agents that begin with the letter E, such as E110, are commonly added to dried food and treats.
These coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals, though again, it's more likely that you're allergic to the animal itself or its bedding.
Talk to an allergist to determine the source of your allergies and find ways to treat or avoid those allergens.

Set the hay rack in the cage.",How to Set Up a Guinea Pig Cage," Guinea pigs need a cage that is at least 7.5 square foot and even bigger for three. The bigger the cage the better! Guinea pigs love to run around (often called zoomies) and popcorning. They can't do this in a tiny amount of space. A large cage is essential for exercise too., Hutches are typically suited for the outdoors. You can purchase a simple one-story hutch with an opening and built-in hut or opt for a two-story hutch with a ramp. Two-story hutches provide more room but they are still limited. Hutches that expand outwards can also be bought., These cages cannot be kept outdoors and must be positioned indoors. C & C caging has become increasingly popular for it's large sizing, simple DIY, cheap material and easy expansion and access. If you would like an indoor cavy, a C & C cage is the one for you., Coops are just as good as a normal hutch. Coops can actually be a better alternative to a hutch as they're often bigger to fit a flock of standard chickens. Some have attached runs to enable your guinea pig to have access to the lawn., These are another satisfactory cage to buy but don't fall into the trap of getting a cage that's too small for your guinea pig or has a wired bottom. Purchase one that is at least 7.5 square feet.

Don't buy wired cages that are designed for mice, rats or hamsters. Guinea pigs are completely different to these smaller rodents and cannot withstand the same living conditions.

, Runs provide a lot of beneficial space, but they aren't the safest or best of cages to use. They don't have much coverage from predators and cannot protect your guinea pigs from harsh weather conditions.

A run is best used for guinea pigs on sunny days to provide exercise and fun time for your cavy under your supervision.

, Many pet shops tend to sell their customers cages that are way too small and are just not suitable for a guinea pig to live in. Most don't meet the minimal requirements of 7.5 square feet and are more designed for small rodents such as mice and hamsters rather than cavies., This is a once popular option (and still is) for those who don't put in the time to research the requirements of a guinea pig. These types of caging don't allow for proper air circulation or provide enough space., The cage you purchase should have a flat, solid bottom. Guinea pigs have sensitive feet. A wire bottom will promote the growth of bumble foot which will then require medical care., If you have cats and dogs or other wild predators in the area it's your job to ensure that your guinea pigs cage is safe and secure. Make sure that there are locks to the cages, a roof, solid floor and strong wood/metal.

A wired cage or C & C cage will not suffice outdoors. They aren't stable and don't provide protection from predators.

, If you live in a very cold or hot climate, you should consider keeping your guinea pigs indoors or at least have a back-up indoor cage for your guinea pig to stay when the colder/hotter months peak. Guinea pigs are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and must eat a lot more to keep warm.

Ideally, the guinea pigs should be kept in a room that is approximately 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit.
Guinea pigs don't do well in humid locations such as sheds and garages on hot days. Humidity encourages bacteria to grow and can cause a fungal infection.
Guinea pigs have sensitive hearing so shouldn't be placed in an area that is prone to loud noises such as right beside televisions or loud stereos.
If you have young children, place your guinea pigs cage in a room where you can monitor them and supervise any small children at the same time.
As much as it's popular, keeping your guinea pig outdoors isn't suggested as they don't like being confined in solitary. Make your guinea pig feel a part of the family. Keeping them in your bedroom should also be avoided as it's another way for them to be forgotten.

, If you're buying a cage that requires a ramp, or already comes with one, make sure the ramp you acquire is suitable for your guinea pig. The ramp mustn't be too steep where your guinea pig is prone too falling and it should have a good grip on it so that your guinea pig can go up and down with no problems., There are many types of bedding to avoid when it comes to choosing the perfect material for your guinea pig. This includes certain brands and even certain wood.

Never use cedar or pine shavings. These type of wood are toxic to guinea pigs and can cause serious respiratory problems. The oils in them get stuck in their lungs. However, pine can be used as long as it's aired out.
Never use sawdust. Again, the dust that is inhaled by guinea pigs is a major cause of respiratory disease and sneezing.
Never use corncob bedding. Corncob has a tendency to mold and is hard on their feet. Since guinea pigs have sensitive feet you should steer clear of corncob.Never primarily use newspaper. Although newspaper is perfectly fine itself and can be used as lining at the bottom of the cage, it isn't absorbent enough to use as your main bedding.
Never use straw. Straw is tough and can easily cause eye injuries. It isn't absorbent enough to be used as bedding and can also be expensive.

, Many guinea pig experts suggest to stay away from wood shavings as a lot of risks are involved with the use of this material such as oils that dry the skin, dust that ultimately causes respiratory problems and possible eye irritation., Fleece is a popular choice to use as bedding as it seems to have little to no problems at all. However, keeping your guinea pig on fleece will require more regular cleaning including spot cleaning daily and an overall clean weekly., Shredded bedding can be purchased from pet stores or you can shred your own. It's quite absorbent and soft on your cavies feet without any toxins in it. This makes it a safe material to use. However, it will absorb their urine and make the smell linger., CareFresh helps eliminate odours and is soft on the guinea pigs feet. However, some tend to avoid unnaturally scented or colored bedding to lessen any risks., Aspen is another popular choice as it contains no toxic oils, unnatural scents or dyes. It's completely natural and safe to use. You can buy this specific kind of bedding at pet stores., Hay can be quite absorbent, natural, safe and help control odours. However, it's quite pricey if you don't buy it from the right place. Pet stores are notorious for overcharging when it comes to hay. But you can easily purchase hay from equestrian centers or farm stops for approximately $5 a bale., You can opt for a water bottle or a water bowl which are completely different to each other. You can always buy both if you have more than one guinea pig.

Water bottles keep bedding, food and hay out of the water if your guinea pig is living in a smaller area but they're notorious for leaking and soiling the bedding.
Water bowls don't leak and are a more natural way for your guinea pig to acquire water. But they can get messy if you use wood shavings as bedding or keep their food/hay nearby.

, The guinea pig pellets should be kept inside the bowl for hygienic reasons and to keep them from spoiling. You can purchase two if you would like to keep their vegetables in a bowl also or even more if you have two guinea pigs (or more) that require 1 cup of vegetables each., Guinea pigs are prey animals; their instinct is to hide when in fear. You need to have at least one or two hide-outs for your guinea pigs as a safe place and a relaxing centre. One of the worst things you can do is stress your guinea pig out, and with the option of seeking refuge in a hut, you can reduce stress levels., Toys help stimulate the mind and encourage exercise and, of course, promote fun and enjoyment! Toys are a great way to reduce boredom, depression and even loneliness. However, don't overcrowd their cage with toys. Guinea pigs need space to run too!

Toy obstacles can promote exercise whilst chew toys can help prevent dentistry problems as guinea pig teeth are forever growing.Consider toys such as igloos, tunnels, bridges, wood blocks, cat toys (with bells on them), cage accessories, hammocks, cosies, etc.
Don't buy wood toys that splinter, wire balls or any toys that can be a choking hazard.

, Hay racks can help bundle the hay together and keep it in place, making the overall space of the cage cleaner and more hygienic. However, avoid wire hay racks and opt for cotton bags/sacks instead. There are a number of incidences of guinea pigs getting their heads/bodies stuck in between the wires., Guinea pigs need their cages cleaned at least once a week and sometimes daily if you decide to spot clean (especially if you're using fleece bedding). You will need a brush, cloth, gloves, pet-friendly antibacterial spray, scooper, bin bags, etc., This is optional and most apply to long-haired breeds such as peruvians and shelties. However, you can choose to have some grooming products set aside for whenever you need it. You could also optionally book an appointment with a professional groomer.

Purchase a soft bristled brush. Long haired guinea pigs require daily grooming to prevent knots and matting from forming in their fur.
Purchase clippers. Long-haired breeds such as Shelties have constant growing fur that require clipping annually (or perhaps every few months).
Buy nail trimmers. Occasionally you might have to purchase nail trimmers to clip your guinea pigs over-grown nails.

, Unless you got your hutch home already assembled on a trailer it will require assembling, including store-bought hutches. Hutches are quite easy to assemble providing that you have the instructions and all the parts to it., Your hutch should be out of direct sunlight and preferably in a weather proof area under the roof of the house. The area should be well ventilated, secured away from predators (and other pets) and not too cold or too hot., Straw or wood shavings is recommended for hutches. Ones that go directly on grass will only need bedding in the inside area. Consider lining the hutch with newspaper first and then your main bedding. Guinea pig urine can stain bottom of wooden hutches. The newspaper should catch any leaks.

Hutches are best without the use of fleece.

, Water bottles can connect to the wire bars of the hutch or you can opt towards a water bowl instead. Keep your water bowl a short distance from the pellets to prevent mess., Guinea pigs benefit with at least two shelters to escape to when in fear, especially in an outdoor hutch where many wild animals can scare your guinea pig., Avoid overcrowding the hutch and keep most of the toys outside at the bottom level if it's a two-story hutch. Cosies can be kept in the inside area but to a minimum., Most hay racks can be pitched up between the wires of the hutch, even cotton hay racks. The hay rack would be best positioned on the bottom story of the cage or away from the water bowl.

Remember, guinea pigs will make a lot of mess when it comes to hay. They like to hide in it, pull it out and sleep in it.

, The ramp shouldn't be too steep but should have a good grip on it so your guinea pigs can move up and down without any struggles or slips. It should optionally have juts to make the grip better., Firstly connect the grids which should be able to snap together easily with connectors. Then you will have to set the coroplast at the same length as your grids.Make sure the opening of the cube grids aren't too big/wide enough for your guinea pig to fit it's head through. If it's head can fit through then it's body will fit through too.

, C & C's are not outdoor cages as they aren't secure or weather proof at all! Keep it in a room where you can supervise any young children but also keep it away from pets and loud noises. However, do not isolate the cage. The guinea pigs should feel a part of the family not placed in solitary confinement., Your bottom layer should be lined up with newspaper for extra absorbency and to catch any leaks, and then your primary bedding. Fleece is best suited for C & C cages, but it doesn't limit you to the choice of many other types of bedding such as wood shavings or CareFresh., Water bottles can be hooked onto the grids and your bowls can be positioned beside your water source (unless you're using a bowl). Don't place the pellets directly under the water bottle as bottles have the tendency to leak which will spoil the feed., In an open cage without a lid, you should have plenty of coverage with the use of huts, bridges, shelters and hide-outs to help your guinea pig feel safe and secure and to give them a place to run to when in fear. At least two should be satisfactory for your guinea pig - the more guinea pigs the more hide-outs!, A spacious C & C cage could benefit with some toys for your guinea pigs entertainment. You could add various tunnels, hammocks and toy balls., You can hook the hay rack onto the grid or, if you don't have one, place a pile of hay in the centre of the cage. Most hay racks can be purchased online or in pet stores. Avoid wire racks however., Coops are very similar to hutches but most are a lot bigger than guinea pig hutches. You can assemble them in the same manner. They should come with instructions and all the necessary parts to assemble., Coop best dwells on grass, which will save you on bedding expenses. There's no need for lining the bottom layer with bedding as long as the coop is resting on grass. Most coops can go in direct sunlight as their construction and frame offers permanent shade for your piggy, but keep it under the shade of a tree on hotter days., Coops can go on grass so it saves you spending a fortune on bedding. But the nesting box/area still needs to be lined up with bedding. It's suggested to line a bottom layer of newspaper and then shavings/hay., Like other cages, the bottle can grip onto the grids/wiring. However, keep your pellets away from the edges of the cage as sudden rainy showers can spoil the unprotected food. Keep it under the nesting box/ramp., The ramp shouldn't be too steep and should have a proper grip via soft sandpaper or juts in the ramp structure. If your guinea pig is slipping or struggling to go up and down the ramp, you might need to make some adjustments as the ramp is designed for chickens rather than rodents., Guinea pigs still need a place to escape to even in a protected coop. If your guinea pigs live outdoors it's important for your guinea pigs to have a quick place to hide, especially on the lower level., Tunnels, cosies, toy balls and wood blocks can all make the coop seem a lot homely and friendly to your guinea pigs. Avoid adding too many toys, however., The hay rack should be able to clip onto the grids of the coop. Opt for cotton hay racks instead of wire hack racks which are proven to be dangerous to your guinea pig. You should place it at the bottom of the cage., Wired cages are just as easy to assemble as hutches and C & C caging. They're actually very similar to C & C cages and can be set up the same way., Wired cages aren't suitable to go outdoors and should be kept inside your home. The cage offers no protection from predators or harsh weather conditions thus why it should be kept inside of your house where the guinea pig can get plenty of family interaction., The type of bedding you use is very similar to C & C cages. Fleece is the most popular options, however you can still use any other bedding choice available. You should line newspaper at the bottom to ensure extra absorbency and so that you can catch leaks., As usual, the bottles can be hung up by the grids whilst pellets should be placed in the bowl and away from the water source to prevent leaks into the food., You should provide at least two huts for your guinea pig, however keep it at a minimum as the space is limited., Space availability in wire cages can be limited, so keep the toys to a minimum. The maximum might be three or four. Remember to add various toys such as tunnels, wood blocks and hammocks for your guinea pigs to play with., As mentioned in the steps above you can hook the hay rack to the cage, but avoid using wired hay racks with can pose a potential hazard to your guinea pig."

You can purchase these from warehouse/pet stores or build your own. The cage must be at least 4 square feet for each guinea pig housed in it (the more the better) or at least 8 square feet for two.

Don't fall into the trap of buying inappropriate sized cages from pet shops that do not hold enough space for guinea pigs.
If you want to keep your guinea pig indoors then a C & C cage is recommended. Hutches are recommended if you're keeping your guinea outside.
The cage must have a solid floor. Don't purchase one with a wired floor as guinea pigs have fragile feet. Wire flooring can and will easily cause bumble foot.
Most C & C cages do not have lids. If your cage is going outdoors, you have small children or dangerous pets in the house then you will need a lid on your cage.
Do not use an aquarium for a cage as the glass sides don't provide good ventilation and most are terribly small.;
, You will need two layers of bedding to ensure extra absorbency as guinea pigs tend to wee a lot. Your first layer should be either newspaper or puppy pads which will take in any leaks and protect the flooring. The second layer should be either wood shavings or fleece lined on top of the first layer.

Fleece is more suitable for indoor cages such as C & C cages but will require more regular cleaning and possibly spot cleaning. And cleaning the fleece is a bit more difficult as you will need to shake off and vacuum the fleece before washing it.
Wood shavings require less regular cleaning and is generally easier to clean. It's also less smelly and more absorbent.

, You will want to keep the cage in an area where it's safe, secure and away from any toxins or dangerous pets. Guinea pigs like somewhere that doesn't get too stressful or too noisy - somewhere that gets light traffic.

Keep the cage out of direct, constant sunlight. Morning sun is adequate for guinea pigs but they prefer to keep out of constant sunlight.
Keep the cage away from any dangerous pets and small children. Dogs and cats will easily scare your guinea pigs as would small children who aren't supervised.
Do not keep the cage in a garage where toxic fumes are given off from cars. This could be fatal to your guinea pigs.

, Water bottles are less messy but some do leak. However bowls don't leak and are more natural to the guinea pig but if you use wood shavings expect to see some mess.

Some guinea pigs prefer to drink from bottles whilst other like bowls as a more natural instinct. Ask the previous owner of the guinea pigs to see which one they use.
Remember to never add vitamin supplements to your guinea pigs water as it isn't effective and your guinea pig could refuse to drink.

, Your guinea pig will need somewhere to eat. Purchase two bowls - one for pellets and one for vegetables. You should avoid chucking their food on the ground as it's unsanitary., Guinea pigs will need pellets and plenty of vegetables every day. Pellets should be unlimited however whilst they need 1 cup of mixed vegetables a day (each). So make sure to plan ahead!

Make sure to purchase plain pellets rather than a guinea pig mix. Guinea pigs will pick out their favourite treats out of a mix which results to them not eating what they actually need.
You can also optionally purchase commercial treats if you plan on training your guinea pig. However, treats should be kept to a limit due to the high sugar content.

, Guinea pigs need an unlimited supply of hay as they are grazing animals. If they aren't constantly chewing on something their digestive tracts can shut down.

Purchase a reliable, good quality manufacture of hay such as oxbow and/or timothy hay. Alfalfa should only be fed to guinea pig pups and nursing or pregnant sows.

, An hay dispenser will lessen the mess of hay and make it last longer rather than scattering the hay on the floor. You can purchase a hay dispenser from a pet shop or use a small paper bin instead., A main criteria that needs to be met for guinea pigs is entertainment and comfort through toys and tunnels.

You should have at least two huts/tunnels or one hut/tunnel per guinea pig. Guinea pigs like being hidden and need a place to run to when scared or in conflict. You can build a critter-safe hut or find one at a pet store.
Some log tunnels even act as a double as they import into bridges due to their flexibility (if tied together with string).
Toys are a great boredom buster for guinea pigs but make sure the toy you purchase is safe and has no negative reviews. Some toys can be dangerous so watch out.
Something as simple to chew on could be a great and beneficial toy for your guinea pig and help grind down their large teeth.

Each type of monkey has unique characteristics that affect how they fare as pets. Before you decide which type to get, conduct a lot of research on its characteristics. Read books, talk to owners, and get to know as many monkeys as you can in person.


Squirrel monkeys, capuchins, spiders, and macaques are all types of monkeys people keep as pets. Some are more social, while others can be on the nervous side. These monkeys all have the same general care requirements, though larger monkeys will need more space than the smaller ones.
Apes, such a chimpanzees, gibbons and orangutans are not monkeys and should not be kept as pets. They are much stronger than humans and can become quite dangerous in a domestic situation.;
, Bringing a monkey into your home is almost as big a commitment as deciding to have a child. Monkeys require attention all day, every day, and unlike cats and dogs, they cannot be left at home for extended periods of time. Once your monkey bonds with you, he will want to follow you wherever you go, and if you try to leave him by himself he will become bored, depressed and aggressive. Monkeys can live for 20 to 40 years, so bringing one home is a commitment to spend a significant portion of your life providing for your monkey's needs. Before you decide to get a pet monkey, ponder the following facts about life with a monkey:


The monkey may become aggressive. When monkeys are babies, they are dependent and sweet, like baby humans. But when they reach sexual maturity, which happens around age 3 or 4, their behavior can become unpredictable. Monkeys are wild animals, and unlike cats and dogs, they have not been socialized to live with humans over thousands of years. Even a monkey who has bonded with a human as a baby may unpredictably bite and attack his owner or become quite difficult to live with as an adult.
You'll have to say goodbye to your free time. Monkeys cannot be left to their own devices. They need constant attention and care, or else they can end up hurting themselves or someone else. And since they tend to bond with just one person, it's difficult to find a good monkey-sitter when you need some time to yourself.
Your monkey may prevent you from having relationships you want. Monkeys tend to bond with just a few people. Having a monkey might prevent you from getting intimately involved with potential partners to whom the monkey has a negative reaction. Monkeys don't get along well with children, so having a monkey could keep you from starting a family.
All that said, if you are one of the unique people with the temperament and discipline it takes to devote your life to the safety and care of your monkey, you may be rewarded with an amazing experience. Monkeys are intelligent, endlessly entertaining, and sometimes incredibly affectionate. Many people who share their lives with monkeys embrace the challenges and wouldn't trade their time with their beloved pets for anything.

, It is illegal to have a pet monkey in many states, and more states will probably pass laws against the practice in the future. For this reason, it's difficult to move to a new state or travel across state lines when you own a monkey. It's illegal to bring a monkey into the US, so that means you can't travel abroad with your monkey and then try to bring him home.


Some states allow monkeys to be kept as pets, but have strict regulations as to the conditions under which the monkeys should be contained.
Regulations regarding pet monkeys are different in countries outside the US. Look into the laws in your jurisdiction to find out whether there are any restrictions on which animals you can keep as pets.

, When you've decided that it's time to get a monkey, do research in your area to find a dealer or breeder with an established reputation as someone who can be trusted. They should have a USDA permit number, which is required of all breeders in the United States.


Ask the dealer or breeder for the contact information of someone else who has bought a monkey from them. That way you can check into the monkey's health and behavior.Expect to pay upwards of $1,000 for a monkey of any species. A baby squirrel monkey can cost over $8,000. Older monkeys are less expensive, but much more difficult to handle once you bring them home.
Before you make a purchase, visit with the monkey you'd like to buy and make sure you have a connection and can see yourself living with the monkey.
Never purchase a monkey from outside the country. It's illegal to ship a monkey from outside the United States.

, Before you bring a monkey home, it's important to establish a relationship with an exotic animals veterinarian. A regular veterinarian will not have the necessary expertise and equipment to care for a monkey. Monkeys are prone to catching some of the same illnesses that humans have, as frequently as humans, so you can expect that your monkey will get sick from time to time. An exotic animals vet will also be a good resource for you when you have questions about your monkey's needs or behavioral issues., Your pet monkey might spend time out of his cage, but he'll need a place to stay at night and during times when you aren't available to play. A monkey's cage should be quite large, the bigger the better.Monkeys need plenty of room to run around, explore and play, especially if they're going to spend more than an hour or two at a time in the cage. If the cage is too small, the monkey will become agitated and potentially aggressive.


You can purchase a monkey cage, but many owners prefer to build their own so they can customize them to their personal space. Wooden or steel poles and chain-link fencing make good materials for monkey cages. You may want to have an outdoor monkey cage as well as one indoors, or build a monkey cage attached to a heated outdoor shed that will provide shelter for the monkey.
Be sure to follow your state's regulations regarding the dimensions, entryways and locks on monkey cages. In some cases the regulations differ according to what type of monkey you own.
Monkeys like to climb, so provide a cage with plenty of height. Add branches, hanging ropes, and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage.

, Most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house, rather than just in their cages. Monkeys are curious, intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them, so you'll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage. Since monkeys can climb, your monkey-proofing will have to be more extensive than baby-proofing would be.


Don't let monkeys have access to anything with a cord. Make sure all electronics are out of their reach.
They'll tear down curtains, knock over lamps and chew on furniture. Put away any items you aren't comfortable letting them destroy.
You might want to have one or two designated ""monkey rooms"" that the monkeys are allowed to play in, and have the rest of the house be off-limits. Remember that monkeys can turn doorknobs and open windows, so if you're planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised, you'll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be, with locks and bars on the windows.

, Monkeys keep their own bodies clean, but they leave a mess wherever they go. They aren't easy to house-train, and they excrete whenever and wherever they choose. Some people put diapers on baby monkeys, but this isn't usually possible once the monkeys mature. Rather, you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home.

, Monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles. You can use baby bottles for this purpose. Some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish, and some might like to have both options. However you administer the water, make sure there's no chance the monkey will run out.

, Monkey biscuits, or commercial monkey food, should be fed to your monkey every single day. These biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkey's needs. In addition to monkey biscuits, monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or steamed vegetables.You may also feed your monkey grasshoppers, mealworms, cooked chicken (with no spices), hard boiled eggs, yogurt, rice, grain and nuts.
Do not feed your monkey anything that is considered ""junk food"" for a human. Sugary treats, ice cream, baked goods, snack foods, fast food, and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey.
Depending on the type of monkey you have, you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins. Monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin D to account for the lack of sun exposure.

, Monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy. In the wild, they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food. Simulate that experience in your monkey's cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart.


Try hiding the monkey's food inside a box, or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into. The monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food.
Give the monkey stuffed animals, balls, and other toys to throw around and play with. Switch out the toys frequently so the monkey won't get bored.

, Monkeys are social creatures, and when they're left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy. Spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day. As you bond with your monkey, he'll start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses.


If you have more than one monkey, less social time is necessary. Many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind. If you can afford more than one, they'll live happily together in the same cage.

, Hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you. It's also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkey's behavior. Remember that monkeys are wild, and they simply can't be trained to do exactly what you want them to do. From time to time they'll exhibit behaviors you might not like. Punishing them will only hurt your relationship.


The best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isn't lacking something that he needs to be content. Does he have enough stimulation every day? Is he getting plenty of exercise? Are you playing with him enough?
Monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time. Again, you can't deal with this by punishing the monkey. Instead, get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite.

, It's not a good idea to take your monkey out in public, or invite people to your home to play with him. Monkeys are too unpredictable. Your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens. If your monkey so much as scratches someone, an Animal Control officer has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies. When exotic animals are confiscated, they are often euthanized, since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals (as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs).


If you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone else's care, make sure it's someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust. Leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences.

, Say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy, so he'll begin to learn it. When he responds, give him a treat and praise him. Teach him commands by showing him how to act. For example, if you say ""dance,"" start hopping around and dancing. When he learns a trick, give him treats and praise him.

Use fully secured bins.,
Don't feed monkeys.,
Pick the fruit from your trees.,
Monkey-proof all the houses.,
Avoid the use of plastic bags.,
Spread the word.",How to Repel Monkeys from Residential Areas1," It is most likely that monkeys will be attracted to residential areas if they think they can access food easily. Before you think about installing any alarms or security devices to repel moneys you should make sure you are not encouraging them to enter your neighbourhood. The first thing to do is check that there are no open or inadequately secured bins which monkeys can gain easy access to.Use monkey-proof bins which can be properly secured and will not attract monkeys.
You can secure bin lids with an elastic strap or bungee cord.Tie all refuse bags with a double-knot and make sure that no food waste is left lying around, or spilling out of the bins.
Having easily accessible food in rubbish areas will encourage monkeys to move further into residential areas and even enter houses.;
, As well as ensuring that food waste and rubbish areas are closed off and monkey-proofed, it is essential that you and your neighbours do not feed monkeys in the area. If the monkeys get fed they will come back looking for more food. You can try to cut off their access to human sources of food so they continue to forage in their natural habitat not in urban areas.Do not feed monkeys or any other wild animals or you will attract them to where you live and make repelling them much harder.Preventing and discouraging the monkeys from entering human settlements is the most important first step.
Once monkeys know there is a food source they are likely to visit every day., If you have fruit trees around your house or in your neighbourhood don't forget that these are a potential food source that could attract monkeys. You should harvest any fruit trees as soon as possible in order to reduce the chances of monkeys finding the fruit.If this is a consistent problem, consider whether you should continue to cultivate fruit trees.


If you are growing vegetables in the ground, be sure to cover them with a strong wire mesh that is designed to resist primates., As well as securing all the bins, it is also important not to make it easy for monkeys to enter your house to look for food. To do this, ensure that all windows are secured. You can simply close the windows, or monkey-proof them with a mesh covering.Meshing a window and keeping food out of sight will discourage curious monkeys., If you have monkeys in the area you should avoid using plastic bags as much as possible when you are walking around. Put any plastic bags inside canvas bags instead. Monkeys are curious and will snatch plastic bags which have food in and forage through rubbish bags. They can easily tear through the plastic so ensure they do not have the opportunity., If you live in an area that borders the edge of a forest where monkeys live, it's important that you make sure your neighbours understand what to do to discourage monkeys from entering your residential area. If you secure the bins, close windows, and don't feed the monkeys, but other people aren't so vigilant the problem won't be solved. Be sure to speak to your neighbours and explain how discouraging monkeys is the most effective way to deal with it.


Education and awareness raising are essential for long-term solutions to be successful.
You need everyone to buy in and take responsibility."

, Your guy may want to kiss you, but may be nervous to do so in front of other people. The only prompting he may need to kiss you is to be alone with you. If you are with a group of friends or at a party, make up an excuse that leads to the two of you being by yourselves. Walk up to him, touch his arm, and tell him you want to speak with him. Or, grab his hand and ask him to come with you--he’s your boyfriend after all!


Stay close to him when you two are alone. If you're not that close to him or you keep something in between you two, he may think you don't want to kiss.

, You don’t have to lay out a candlelit dinner to make a moment feel romantic. Anything that involves physical contact is good. If you can cause a bit of sexual tension, even better.


Invite him over to watch a movie or show. Let him sit down on the couch first--you could even make up an excuse to go make popcorn so that he settles in first. When you come back, slide in right next to him, leaving no room for him to chicken out and move away. Chances are, he will put his arm around you--a stepping stone on the path to kissing.
Have a picnic somewhere secluded. When you two are picnicking, cuddle up close to him and hold out a strawberry or grape, suggesting with your actions that you want to feed it to him. Move your eyes from his eyes to his lips, and back up. When you feed it to him, let your fingertips lightly brush his lips.

, If your guy is shy, he’s probably looking for a subtle way to get close to your face, so give him a reason to do so. Come up with a clever reason for the two of you to get close to each other. When he leans in, give him your best ‘smoldering-temptress-wanting-to-be-kissed’ look. Your ruse may create the moment he has been looking for to kiss you.Tell him that you want to get a better look at his eye color, or that you think there is something in your eye and you’d really appreciate him looking. You could also pretend that there is a crumb on his face--lean in when you ‘wipe’ it off and look up into his eyes.

, Touch his elbow, hold hands, brush his hair out of his face or gently put a hand on his knee. Tearing down this barrier will help the both of you get past some of the hang-ups that you may have about physical contact.


Once you've broken the touch barrier keep on breaking it. When you laugh, place your hand on his arm. When you walk, grab his hand and hold it. Hopefully he will meet you halfway and begin grabbing your hand too.

, Cuddling lets him know that you like physical contact, and that you are really comfortable with him. It is one of the biggest clues you can give him--and cuddling often leads to kissing.


While you are cuddling, lean your head against his shoulder. Entwine your fingers with his and lean back contentedly. All of these physical clues will tell your guy, “I love being close to you, now kiss me you silly boy!”

, Getting your guy’s full attention on your lips will make the idea of kissing you unavoidable. Do everything you can to keep his attention on your lips. A classic approach is to bite your lip gently while looking at him.Apply lip balm to your lips (and let him watch you do it.) Just keep in mind that lip gloss can be sticky, and thus make your kiss sticky. Use a lip balm or chapstick if you want to avoid a sticky situation.
Run an ice cube over your lips if it's hot out. Not only will this look seductive, it will also give your lips a shiny look similar to balm.
Lick your lips as if you’re eating something juicy. If you are eating watermelon, ice cream, or something that is drip prone, let a little get on your lips and then slowly lick it off. Just be careful to avoid looking like a slob when trying this--you are going for temptress, not ‘girl in serious need of a napkin.’

, Eye contact is a big part of clueing your guy in on the fact that you want to be kissed. Look him in the eyes and smile gently. Smile with your eyes. Glance from his eyes to his lips a couple times, perhaps adding a flirtatious batting of your eyelashes.


Here is another way to flirt with your eyes: when you two are looking at each other, especially when your faces are close together, hold eye contact for a moment, then drop your eyes bashfully. Look down for a moment, and then glance back up.

, If you are hoping for a good night kiss, this is particularly important. When you are saying goodbye, hug him close and kiss him on the cheek. After kissing him on the cheek, look into his eyes. Even if he doesn't kiss you right then, you will have shown him that you are perfectly fine with kissing and physical contact.


When hugging him, you could place your head on his chest so that he holds you closer. If you do this, make sure to have some irresistible perfume on--he won’t be able to help but notice how delicious you smell.

, Just because he is your boyfriend already doesn't mean you should stop flirting. Flirting keeps a relationship light and healthy--plus it will show him that you’re still very into him. Play coy and tease him (but not too much.) You could even tease him about not kissing you (which is a pretty direct way of saying ‘I want you to kiss me!’)


Send him flirty text messages when you guys aren't together. Flirtatious, funny texts are a great way to be cute with him even when you’re not around him. Just keep in mind that you don’t want to overload him with texts--that can be a turn off.

, Guys like to feel like they are the big, strong men in girls’ lives--so make your guy feel that way. Even if you don’t necessarily need him to open a tightly-lidded jar, it's a nice confidence boost for him when you say something like ‘ooh! Look at those muscles!’ This is, of course, another form of flirting, but it is the kind that will boost his confidence--hopefully giving him the confidence to then lean in and kiss you!

, Being direct has its ups and downs. The ups are, you will most likely get results immediately, and it will show your guy how confident you are--which is very sexy. The downside is that the results you get immediately might not be the ones you want. He may still need some time to overcome his shyness, or he might not be as into it as you thought. No matter what, you will get results--and you are taking the pressure off him by telling him exactly what you want.


You can make your request sexy and still direct. When you are hugging goodbye, lean in close so that your lips brush his ear and whisper something like “Kiss me” or “I want to kiss you.” Chances are, your words, and that little brush of your lips, will be enough to make him lose any shyness he might have and go right in for the kiss.

Recognize that capuchins were not meant to be quiet and isolated animals.,
Consider your capuchin’s needs to address why they are being so vocal.",How to Quiet a Capuchin Monkey1," While dogs and cats have lived with humans for thousands of years, capuchins are wild animals and not domestic pets. As a result, you should not hold them to the same standards as traditional pets, expecting them to be tame and quiet.If you want a quiet pet, a capuchin might not be the right choice.
While capuchins might seem docile, calm, and friendly as infants, they often become louder, unpredictable, and sometimes aggressive as adults.;
, The more you know about capuchins, the better you will be able to recognize what sort of behaviors or noises are normal and which ones might be an indication of a medical or emotional problem.Capuchins communicate with each other (or their human companions) using calls and vocalizations, which convey fear, excitement, happiness, and other emotions.
Learn about their behavior in the wild and in captivity so you will be better able to interpret and understand these vocalizations.

, In the wild, capuchins live in large, noisy groups of 10-35 primates.Since capuchins make noise in the wild, it is unreasonable and unfair to expect them to be quiet or silent in captivity.
When kept in captivity, they are often more content in pairs., If your capuchin’s needs aren’t being met, they might become very loud. Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind:Make sure they have large spaces to exercise, both indoors and outdoors.
Capuchins also need a lot of mental stimulation, so provide them with toys and puzzles that you change out regularly so they are not bored and acting out.
Ensure they have a varied and balanced diet. In addition to primate food, offer them fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, eggs, and insects."

End on a good note.",How to Kiss Your Girlfriend in Middle School," Let’s face it. It may be hard to get complete privacy in middle school, but you have to do the best you can to make sure that you and your girlfriend can step away from your friends to get some time together. You could step outside during the school dance, find some solo time during a party, or even go out on a date together. Just do the best you can to make sure that there’s no chance that your friends can barge in and start making fun of you and ruin the mood.


Avoid trying this in school for the first time. You’ve got to find a slightly more romantic location.
This doesn’t mean you should try to kiss your girlfriend the second you’re alone together. The moment has to feel right, and privacy isn’t the only requirement for that.;
, If you’re ready to kiss your girlfriend, then your breath better be ready, too. You don’t have to make dramatic gestures and eat ten breath mints, but you should brush your teeth if you know you’re going to see your girlfriend soon. And if you’ve both just eaten a meal, just quickly chew a piece of gum. Don’t make a big deal about it or she’ll know that you’re self-conscious about kissing her.


You can also put on some lip balm a few hours before to soften up your lips, but don’t use it right before you make a move or your lips won’t feel too pleasant.

, Once you’ve got her alone, you can’t just swoop in for the kiss or it will feel a bit forced. Instead, you have to show your girlfriend that you care about her by making her feel special. Give her a compliment, like, “You look so pretty tonight,” or say something nice like, “I’ve had so much fun with you today.” You don’t have to try too hard to show her that you really do care about her. Turn off your phone, look into her eyes, and show her that she has your undivided attention.


If you want to kiss your girlfriend, then she has to feel like you really like her for who she is, and that you see her as more than just a person to kiss.

, Before you kiss your girlfriend, you have to make sure that you’re on the same page. This is probably your first kiss, and it may be her first kiss, too, so you really want her to feel ready to make this move with you. Though you don’t have to think of kissing her as a huge deal, it will be something she’ll remember, so you have to see if she’s into it. See if she’s moving closer to you, looks happy to see you, looks at your lips, and self-consciously touches her face or plays with her hair. This is a sign that she’s interested in kissing you and that she may be a little nervous.


If she’s always trying to pull away when you’re alone together, and moves further and further away from you, then she may not be ready to take it to the next level with you. This doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like you, but it does mean that she’s not ready yet.

, You shouldn’t go from standing two feet apart from your girlfriend to planting a big wet one on her face, or she’ll be caught off guard. Instead, move closer to her and make some physical contact. If you’re sitting, you can sit closer to her, put your hand on her knee, or play with her hair. If you’re standing, you can also touch her hair or her face, brush a hand along her waist, or just give her some kind of physical closeness to show that you’re ready to make a move.


This will also be a good time to see if she’s ready. Does she respond well to your touch, move closer to you, or even initiate some touching?

, If you’re kissing your girlfriend in middle school for the first time, there are a few things you may want to avoid:



French kissing. This is not for everybody, and most people don’t start French kissing until high school. For your first kiss, keep the tongue out of it, or your girlfriend may be unpleasantly surprised. If you come out of the gate with a French kiss, it’ll be too much, too soon.
The roaming hands. Just because your girlfriend is ready for a kiss doesn’t mean she’s ready for you to start creeping all over her body. You can touch her in safe, PG areas to show her that you care, but you don’t want to creep her out by suddenly touching her in a place where she’s definitely not ready to be touched.
The sneak attack kiss. Avoid just jumping in and kissing her without any indication of what’s going to happen. Though some element of surprise is nice, you don’t want your girlfriend to not know what’s going on when you make your big move.

, Once you’ve made physical contact, all you have to do is move a bit closer to her until your faces are very close together. If you’re sitting, then you’ll both have to turn your bodies a bit. If you’re standing, you can put your arms around her waist and move closer to her. This should happen slowly and naturally, and you can make eye contact while you get closer.


You can lightly lick your lips a bit to soften them, if you’re not too obvious about it.

, You don’t want to kiss your girlfriend head on, or your noses will get in the way. You should tilt your head slightly in one direction and she should tilt her head slightly in the other. Don’t worry if you don’t get it perfect the first time, or if you both don’t tilt your heads that much. This isn’t so crucial for a regular kiss, so don’t overthink it and tilt your head too much.

, Here’s your big moment! Just lean forward a bit and make the connection, touching your lips to hers. Your lips won’t align perfectly, and you don’t have to worry about it. Relax your lips instead of puckering them, and just gently kiss your girlfriend’s lips. You can hold the kiss for a few seconds, or for as long as you both like.

, This is something you can do while you kiss your girlfriend, if you don’t think it requires too much coordination. Just lightly run your hand over her cheeks or her hair while you’re kissing her. This can be something you do during Round Two, if you go in for another kiss after the first kiss is over.

, While you’re kissing her, you can place your hands on her waist, her upper back, or her knee or shoulder if you’re sitting down. As long as you’re not touching her anywhere inappropriate, a little bit of touch can help the girl feel more in the moment. Don’t overwhelm her, though. If she’s not touching you except with her lips, only a bit of a light touch on your end will be enough.

, This sounds silly, but it’s important. You may be so nervous or excited about finally kissing your girlfriend that you may forget to perform one of the most basic functions of the human being. That means breathing in and out, just as you normally would, while you’re kissing her. If you only kiss for a few seconds, breathing before and after is OK too.

, After a few seconds, you can slowly pull away, while continuing to look into your girlfriend’s eyes. Don’t instantly pull away like you’ve been scorched by a flame. Instead, look at her, smile, and gently move away. You can brush her face or hair for an extra touch.

, Let’s face it. Middle school can be awkward. Kissing for the first time can be weird. But you should do the best you can to make your girl feel comfortable, and to say something like, “That was nice,” to let her know it was a special moment for you. Don’t just take her hand and walk away to join the party and pretend it never happened. It can be hard for guys to express their feelings, but just do the best you can to make the girl feel special and to let her know you had a great time.


And hey, nobody’s stopping you from going in for that second kiss! If the first kiss went well, it’s okay to pull away and to go back for more…and more again!

Ideally, the first kiss will be soft but firm and passionate.;
, Having a clean, healthy mouth will make you more kissable. Having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you.


Make sure you brush twice each day, and floss at least once. It is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss, but for your own health as well.
Have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person.
Don’t chew gum. Although it will give you fresh breath, having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth.

, If your lips are chapped and dry, the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you. Use a lip moisturizer, such as vaseline, regularly.


If you are a girl, avoid sticky lip glosses. The person kissing you may find it weird and unenjoyable if your lips are very sticky and messy.

, This is probably the hardest part of any first kiss. However, if you want to kiss the person you are with, look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you, too. Often, a good time is if you’ve been spending some time together alone, having good conversation.


Are they making a lot of eye contact? Obviously, this doesn’t always mean they want to kiss you, but if they make a lot of eye contact, they at least find you interesting. If they want to kiss you, often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lips.What does their body language say? If they have their arms folded across their chest, then they probably don’t want a kiss; however, if they have their body angled towards you, are sitting or standing close to you with arms open, then it’s likely a good bet.Remember that this moment could be planned or it could happen spontaneously. Try to stay calm and go with the flow. There are certain moments where it is more likely. For example, if it is the end of the night just before you both go home, or if you are alone in a quiet moment.

, Although it is OK to take a quick peek every now and then, it is usually better to keep your eyes closed. If your partner realizes you have your eyes open, he/she might feel uncomfortable.It will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed.

, When the kiss happens, don’t immediately try to stick your tongue in his/her mouth. Instead, start out by gently kissing with just your lips, and if the kiss continues to that, proceed slowly. There is no need to rush when it comes to kissing.

, The worst thing you can do is to over think your first kiss.Remember that no matter what happens, it is only one kiss, and there will be many others. Once you get the first kiss out of the way, you can practice getting better at it.


Enjoy the moment! You only get one first kiss, and you will likely remember it for your entire life.
Be present during the kiss. Don’t start thinking about how you can’t wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary. Simply enjoy it.

, Think about why you want to experience your first kiss? Is it because you think you have to in order to be “cool”? Or, is it because you feel that you actually want to have this experience?


There might be many reasons you want to experience your first kiss, but in general it is a good idea to wait until you feel ready for it.

, Choose someone that you feel comfortable with, and who wants to kiss you back. Typically, this will be your boyfriend or girlfriend, but in some cases it may also be a close friend who wants to have the experience too. Whoever it is, it will be more enjoyable if it is someone you trust and feel comfortable with.


Although the cutest girl or boy in school might be an obvious choice, it doesn’t mean they are the best choice. You should choose someone you find attractive on the inside as much as the outside.

, Ask trusted friends about their first kiss, and how they prepared themselves. Ask them what advice they can give you. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can also discuss it with your parents.


Don't be afraid to ask questions. Almost every one can remember the nervousness and worries they had before their first kiss.

, It's likely that you will be worrying about all the things that could go wrong during your first kiss. Ignore these thoughts.Instead, let yourself think only positive thoughts.


For example, you can think about how you've taken good care of your lips and mouth, making you very kissable. You can think about how into you the person you will be kissing is, and how romantic it will be.

, Although you will be nervous, remember that you deserve to be kissed! Believe that the kiss will go well, and although it may not go perfectly, it will all be OK.


Remember that even if it doesn't go perfectly, it is only the first of many.

, Nearly everyone feels nervous when kissing someone for the first time. This is a biological reaction to our excitement, and doesn’t mean anything bad.Remember that this also goes for the person kissing you back. It can sometimes be a comfort to remember the other person is also nervous.
If you do your best to act relaxed about the kiss, it will help your partner relax too, and you can both enjoy it.

, Often, the first kiss will be everything you hoped it would be despite the fact that it didn't go ""perfectly"". However, if things aren't turning out so well, don't get angry. Instead, pull away from your partner, and smile. It will help both of you relax, and you can try again if you want to.

Monkeys will quickly learn that your neighbourhood is not a good place for them to return to.Do not approach the monkey directly, do not stare at it, and do not try to corner it.
Identify an exit and encourage the monkey to leave by hitting the ground with a stick. Never hit a monkey. A strong jet of water directed toward the monkey can also encourage it towards the exit.If there are juveniles in a group of monkeys be especially cautious. Lower your head, keep your distance and move away., In extreme circumstances, it might be necessary to construct an electric fence around your settlement to stop monkeys from entering. This is not a straightforward task, and you should ensure you have taken the less dramatic steps of securing all bins and closing off any food sources before considering this. There is evidence that electric fences are effective at containing monkeys, and are unlikely to harm the animals if done correctly, but you will need expert help for this.If you think your monkey problem is this serious, contact a local government representative and ask them about electric fencing.
If will not be cheap and in no circumstances should you attempt this on your own.

, Increasingly, places and institutions frequented by monkeys are turning to ultrasound repellent devices to ward off the monkeys. These devices tend to be used where there are lots of people coming and going and it is hard to ensure that no rubbish or food waste is left accessible to monkeys in the area.

If you have to leave your capuchin alone, turn the television on and they will be less lonely and noisy while you are gone., Your capuchin might be vocalizing and acting out because it is bored and needs mental stimulation. To occupy and quiet your capuchin monkey, try out these toys or objects.Tire swings and climbing ropes provide them with a lot of entertainment.
Capuchins like to handle things and tear them, so give them soft items such as cardboard.
Make sure the toys do not have sharp edges or hazardous coatings.
Capuchins like things that are bright and shiny.

, Like other primates, capuchins are known to spend considerable time playing with their reflections in a mirror. This will provide great entertainment for your pet and help keep your capuchin quiet.Use a metal mirror instead of glass so your capuchin is not hurt if the glass breaks.

, Provide your pet with food that doubles as entertainment and keeps them occupied.Give them fruits, seeds, or nuts that they have to crack, peel, or separate.
A piece of fruit frozen in ice or a cob of corn will entertain and stimulate your capuchin, making him or her less likely to be noisy.
For a fun treat, hide peanut butter and honey in a PVC pipe or box and give your capuchin a straw or stick to retrieve it. They will spend time focusing on this task instead of acting out.

, It’s possible that your pet capuchin is being rowdy and noisy because it wants your attention.


Take time every day to play with your capuchin.

Bond with your capuchin.,
Demonstrate that you are in charge.,
Reward your capuchin’s good, quiet behavior.,
Use time outs to punish your capuchin when they are loud.,
Do not resort to physical discipline to quiet your capuchin.,
Be consistent with your commands, especially when you want them to be quiet.,
Ask an expert for help.",How to Quiet a Capuchin Monkey3," The success of training a capuchin to be quiet will depend on whether or not your capuchin respects you and bonds with you. Here are a few important things to keep in mind to increase the strength of your bond.Every time you go near your pet’s cage, stop and speak to your monkey.
Call it by name.
Offer it food or a treat.
Make sure you care for your capuchin’s needs and play with them daily.
Be patient because capuchins are known to be wary of strangers. Don’t expect to bond with them and train them overnight., To get your capuchin to listen and follow your commands to be quiet, you need to show your pet that you are in a dominant position.


Feeding, caring for, and playing with your capuchin will show them you are in charge of their care, and they will depend on you.
Be kind, but firm.
Do not use physical force to emphasize your point because your capuchin might respond aggressively and lose trust.

, When your capuchin is quiet and calm, make sure you offer positive reinforcement in the form of a treat or praise.Marshmallows, yogurt covered raisins, mealworms, or another favorite food works well.
You can also use a new toy or object your capuchin will find interesting.

, If your capuchin is behaving badly and won't be quiet, put your pet in their cage, and walk away. Do not look at your capuchin or interact with it for about 15 minutes.This teaches your capuchin that their behavior is unacceptable.
Because capuchins are social creatures, they will find this time out upsetting and try to avoid it in the future.

, Physical punishment is not effective since capuchins often interpret this as a threat and respond aggressively.Taking these actions jeopardizes your relationship with your pet.
Physical discipline often results in more negative, and violent behavior such as biting.
If you feel yourself getting frustrated with your capuchin, it’s best to take a break so you don’t lose your temper., Use the same commands or words with specific actions so that your capuchin will associate the action with the command.


For example use “Quiet” when you want your capuchin to be quiet. Don’t change things and start using the command “Silent.”

, If your efforts to quiet your capuchin don’t seem to be working and they are unusually loud, it’s a good idea to ask for help from an expert.


Get in touch with your veterinarian to make sure your pet is not ill or injured.
Contact an animal trainer. Although specialized trainers might be difficult to locate in your area, it is worth researching online.

Talking with your friends is a great way to spend the first part of the dance. It also can show your crush if they are watching that you are a social and friendly person.;
, Even if you are nervous at the prospect of talking to your crush, try to have confident body language from the beginning of the dance to the end of the night. Stand up straight, smile, and don’t try to hide yourself. People naturally attracted to confident and positive body language, and if your crush sees you looking uncomfortable or worried they might not want to dance.Even if you feel nervous, smiling and standing up straight can actually trick your body into feeling calmer and more confident. That’s why even if you are nervous, you should fake it till you make it.
Try not to cross your arms or use other closed body language that hides your body. Also try not to hang your head; instead keep it up with your chin level.
Also try not to fidget or anxiously tap your feet, as this will make you look nervous.

, If you are comfortable dancing, dance with your friends at the beginning of the dance. This will show your crush that you like dancing, and may be open to the idea of dancing with them.Try not to dance with another guy or girl. If it seems like you like someone else, your crush will be less likely to dance with you.

, If you see your crush looking in your direction, look at them and smile. Only do this if your crush is nearby or if they are looking at or near you. If you stare at them intensely, that might come across more creepy than cute.Making this non-verbal contact is a good first step because it opens up the window for them to come over and say hello, or even ask you to dance!

Think about people you already know that you might have some special feelings for. Telltale signs that you like someone include being nervous or shy around them, getting excited when you think about that person or see them in the halls, and wanting to spend lots of time together.Sometimes people don’t find love interests among their friends, and if this happens to you, be open to trying new activities where you might meet new people, such as after-school activities, youth programs, and camps.
If somebody asks you out, don’t be afraid to say yes, even if you aren't sure you like the person. Sometimes it just takes getting to know somebody to find you have a real connection.;
, It’s not necessary to know this, but it can be a real confidence booster if you think the person you like feels the same way. It will also make it a lot easier to ask someone out if you think they like you too. If somebody likes you, that person might:Act nervous around you
Show off in front of you
Find common interests with you
Like lots of things you do on Facebook and Twitter
Message and text you often
Steal glances at you in class, in the halls, or when you're out together

, You can't always wait around for love to find you, and sometimes you have to go out and grab it by the horns. If the person you're interested in doesn’t happen to ask you out, take the initiative and do the asking. This can be a really scary thing to do, but sometimes putting yourself out there is the only way you'll get what you want.


Chew some gum or pop a mint in your mouth before you ask so that your breath is minty and fresh.
Find a time to ask the person when you two have a moment alone together, and that way neither of you will feel pressure from friends.
Keep it casual, don’t be nervous, and don’t make a big deal about it. Say something like, “Hey, I was wondering if you would like to see a movie together sometime?” Or, “I was thinking that maybe if your free we could possibly hangout?!”
Make sure you ask in person: don’t send a note, and don’t make a friend ask for you., Getting a boyfriend or girlfriend can be as easy as saying yes when someone asks you out or asking someone out who says yes. But once you get together with somebody, it’s important to start out slow. This means:


Taking time to talk and learn new things about each other.
Holding hands sometimes.
Doing things together a couple times a week, like going bowling, playing together at recess, or having lunch or dinner together.

, Knowing when you're ready to take big steps in life can be hard, and kissing someone for the first time is one of those big steps. If you're wondering if you're ready to kiss someone, ask yourself:Do you think about kissing this person a lot?
Do you have strong feelings for this person?
Are you comfortable around this person?
Does the thought of kissing this person make you happy and excited?
If you answered yes to all or most of these questions, you’re likely ready to kiss that special someone!

, When you're ready to experience a kiss with your partner, there are two things you can do: either wait to be kissed, or initiate the kiss yourself. If you'd rather wait to be kissed, there are ways you can show that you're ready, including:When you hug, hold on a little tighter than usual, and rest your head on your partner’s shoulder
Make lots of eye contact
Smile a lot
Try to find excuses to get close
Touch your hair, as this is a sign of flirting

, You can also choose to initiate the kiss yourself, and there are signs you can look for that will demonstrate that your partner is ready to kiss as well. These include:Making eye contact with you
Making excuses to get close or touch you
Complimenting you often
Blushing or laughing a lot around you
Chewing gum all the time

, Sharing a kiss is something that most people like to do in private, so finding the right time to kiss can be important. For instance, when you pass in the hall in between classes probably isn't the best time to do it! There are lots of places where first kisses happen, including:Bowling alleys
At the movies
A school dance
On a school trip
At camp
On the bus

, Kissing somebody can make you really nervous, but it’s important to stay as calm as you can, in order to avoid sweating excessively, throwing up, or getting too scared and not going through with it. Ways you can keep calm are:


Have a plan about when and where you're going to do it.
Don’t rush yourself. If you aren't actually ready, you might feel extremely nervous before a kiss, and this could be your brain’s way of saying you aren't ready.
Don’t make too big a deal out of it. When you're going to do something that scares you, it can be easy to make it seem like a much bigger deal than it is, and this can make you even more nervous! Have your plan ready and then keep your mind off the kiss until you're ready to do it.

, Figuring out what another person wants based on signals is hard, and it’s easy to misinterpret what people want just based on body language. To avoid making a mistake, simply ask your partner before going in for the kiss.


You can say something like, “May I kiss you?” or “How about we kiss now?”
Don’t worry about thinking that asking might ruin the mood. Your partner will appreciate that you're being respectful and considerate, and that you want the moment to be special for you both.

, When the time comes and you're both ready, just go for it! Sit or stand close enough that you can reach your partner without straining. Look your partner in the eye and tilt your head to one side. If your partner tilts to the other side, close your eyes and lean in for the kiss.


Pucker your lips slightly, and with your mouth closed, press your lips against your partner’s gently but firmly.You want to close your eyes before the kiss because keeping your eyes open can give the impression that you're dishonest.

, Playing a kissing game at a party can be a good way to get a kiss. This method also works if you're trying to get a kiss from a crush that you don’t think feels the same way about you. To play spin the bottle:


Gather a group of at least four to six people, and get everyone to sit in a circle.
Place an empty bottle in the center of the circle.Draw straws, pick the oldest person, or find some other way to determine who goes first. The person who goes first will spin the bottle. When the bottle stops the tip will be pointing at someone, and the spinner has to kiss that person.
The person who got kissed spins next, and so the game continues.

, Seven minutes is another kissing game, but in this one, the two people selected to kiss are sent to a closet alone together for seven minutes. During their time in the closet, it is expected that the two people will be kissing.


Sit everyone in a circle and place a bottle in the center.
Have somebody spin the bottle. When the bottle stops, the tip will be facing one person and the end will be pointing to another.
Those two people are sent to the closet for seven minutes. When they emerge, the bottle is spun again and the game continues.

, In this game, a piece of paper is passed around a circle from person to person via the mouth, and nobody is allowed to use their hands. To play this game:Sit all the players in a circle. Usually, players arrange themselves in a boy-girl-boy-girl pattern.
Take a small piece of paper, such as a business card. The player who starts will press the paper up to his or her mouth, suck air in through the mouth to hold the paper in place, and remove the hands.
The player with the paper then turns to the person on the left, and presses the paper onto the mouth of that person. As they connect, the person passing the paper exhales to release the paper, and the person who’s accepting the paper sucks air in to secure the paper to the mouth.
The paper gets passed around the circle in this way, and the idea is that when the paper gets dropped by accident, the two people passing it will end up kissing.

, Once you've become friends, start partnering up in science class, trying to be on the same team in gym, playing sports together at recess, or just hanging out at the park to do some studying or skateboarding. It's always important to do something your crush likes to do, without making it seem like a date. Do not try to give hugs or affectionately touch each other in any way. You guys are just friends at this stage.

, Once you think your crush likes you, start doing more activities together. When going to a field trip, go to interesting spots together. When you think you want to be more than friends, and you are ready, try asking the other to go out. Don't tell your friends what you're trying to do no matter how trustworthy they may be. They will find a way to embarrass you in front of your crush. Keep what you are doing together a secret; it's your personal business.

, You really need to let your special someone know that you're cool. Don't be up in their face or act weird. They'll start to like you.

, Once you guys are real good friends, go in for the big step. Ask them out. Make it simple. Don't go all crazy with the drama and flowers and all that crap. Just make it sound like your asking what the day's home work was.

Keep it really simple. If you make it too sudden or harsh, they may take it the wrong way.

If they are sitting down, go sit down at a nearby table with some friends. If you and your friends are friends with your crush, join them where they are sitting, and try to make sure that you are sitting next to your crush. If they are dancing, dance with a group of your friends either in a group next to your crush, or join their group of friends.Hanging out near your crush before you approach them makes going up and talking to them less abrupt and more natural.

, Say hello to your crush and ask them how they are doing. Say something like, “Hey Jamie, how are you?” or “Hey, what’s up?” If you’ve never talked to your crush before, introduce yourself.If at this point, your crush’s friends and your friends are hanging out together, it should be easy talk to him or her.
If your crush is with his or her friends, approach them with some of your friends. This will make approaching your crush easier and won’t put you on the spot. While your friends talk to your crush’s friends, you can talk to your crush.
If you and your friends don’t know your crush’s friends well enough to talk with them, wait to talk to your crush when they are alone getting food, checking their phone or coming back from the bathroom.

, Giving your crush a compliment is a good way of keeping the conversation going. Since it’s a dance, your crush probably put a lot of time into their appearance, so complimenting them will make them feel happy that someone noticed.Say something like. “You look nice” or “I like your dress.”

, If you don’t know what else to talk about with your crush, just talk about the dance!


You could ask them how they are enjoying the dance by saying something like, “So are you having fun?”
You could also talk about something specific about the dance by saying something like, “I really like the decorations that they put up!” or “Have you tried the punch? It’s really good.”

, If you and your friends are on the dancefloor near your crush and you start talking to your crush, don’t go on and on. A lot of people talk on the dancefloor while dancing, but the dancefloor isn’t the right place for a long conversation, since your crush might be more in the mood to dance than to talk.


If your crush seems like they are into the conversation, by all means keep talking. However, if you are doing most of the talking, keep in mind that your crush may be more in the mood to dance.

, If you are talking to your crush while you both are sitting down, allow for pauses in the conversation and look over to the dancefloor as you pause. This is a non-verbal way of indicating that you are interested in dancing. You can also tap your feet or move a little to the music to show that you like the song. If your crush wants to dance with you, they may pick up on these cues and ask you to dance.If you are talking to your crush while dancing, a pause is also a good way to give them a window to ask you to dance.
Giving non-verbal cues is a good method for girls to use if they don’t feel comfortable asking a guy to dance. Since the societal norm is for boys to ask girls to dance, girls may prefer to use this method of non-verbally communicating that they want to dance.

If you are sitting and talking to your crush, wait until a song comes on that you want to dance to before asking them. For example, you may wait for a slow song or a song that has a good rhythm.If you are already dancing, you may not have as big of a window to ask them to dance, since your conversation may be shorter. If you absolutely hate the song playing, or you feel like it’s too fast to dance to with your crush, try to keep the conversation going until the next song comes on.

, When a song comes on you like, ask your crush, “Do you want to dance?” Keep the tone of your voice light and casual, and make sure to smile as you ask them.Always ask, even if you are dancing near each other. Unless your crush starts dancing close to you, don’t go up and start dancing in front of or against them. Asking them is cute and polite, whereas starting to dance up in their space can be pushy and creepy.If you’re a girl, don’t let society’s norms stop you from asking your crush to dance! There’s a good chance that they will say yes, and be flattered that you asked.

, Many people get nervous about dancing, so your crush may be hesitant to dance even if they like you. If they say something like, ""I'm not really good at dancing"", offer to teach them some moves that are easy to follow. Even showing them over-the-top moves like ""the sprinkler"" is a good way to be goofy and get them comfortable. Your crush will feel less pressure if they know that you aren't expecting them to look suave or cool.


School dances often play songs that have specific steps. If your crush doesn't want to dance to regular songs, wait until one comes on like the electric slide that follows a routine, and offer to show them how to dance to it.
If you don't know any specific moves or dance steps, you can also just say, ""It's ok, I'm a terrible dancer so I won't judge."" This is a good way of making your crush feel more at ease and willing to dance.

, If your crush says yes, start dancing with them. However, don’t get too close. If you are slow dancing, keep about a foot between yourselves. If you are dancing to a fast song, still try to keep some space between you two., Try to see if your crush is enjoying the dance and wants to get closer. For instance, your crush could close some of the distance between the two of you, or if you are slow dancing they could wrap their arms to hold you closer. They also may look you in the eye and smile, which would be a good indication that they want to get closer., You’ve been dancing at a respectful distance. However, you may see that your crush is enjoying the dance and seems like they would be comfortable getting closer. If you are slow dancing, hold them a little closer to you. If you are dancing to a fast song, move and inch or two nearer to them., Once the song ends, see if your crush wants to dance for another song. If they stay close to you, or start dancing as soon as the new song comes on, it means that they would like to keep dancing. If they move away or give you a hug, it could mean that they enjoyed the dance, but they want to take a break.You can always ask, “Do you want to keep dancing?” if you’re not sure how they are feeling.

Boys can be lazy, so showing a certain amount of confidence and effort can go a long way in improving the quality of a kiss. You may not realize it, but you have a lot to offer that particular boy you’re aiming to kiss, no matter how awesome or cute he is.


Appreciate all your qualities, not only your looks. This can range from your vocabulary and social skills to your passions and hobbies. If you feel confident on one particular aspect of yourself more than others, use that as a starting point and expand.;
, A great way to inspire and maintain confidence is to wear an outfit you’re more than proud of. Pick out a top and bottom you think you could wear anywhere, whether that be a fancy restaurant or over to a friend’s house.


It’s easy to dress to the point that it appears as if you’re trying too hard. Don’t dress in your Sunday best or Prom ready, but wear an outfit you’re sure will grab his attention. Boys rarely dissect what women wear, they only know if they like it or not.

, Style your hair in a way that makes you feel confident. Maybe you like to frame your face with bangs? Maybe you feel the most confident with straightened hair? Pick the one you feel the most confident in.


Like clothes, guys will rarely nitpick your hair and notice small imperfections. They’ll only know that it looks good or bad, so a little effort goes a long way.

, Rock a luscious lip balm, lip-gloss or lipstick to make sure he notices how kissable your lips are. Pick a color that suits your skin tone and clothing selection. Maybe a deep, full red helps brighten your eyes or a light pink really suits the top you’ve picked out. Again, make a selection you're confident in.


These cosmetics will also help smooth – or at least bring attention to – any sort of chapped portions of your lips. The last thing you want to do is be ready to go in for the kiss and notice how rough and cracked they are.

, Freshen up your perfume and breath before you intend to meet your potential kissing mate. Smelling nice – both in and out of your mouth – goes a long way in creating an inviting, welcoming persona. One of the most memorable features in people is their specific aroma – make sure yours is a good one.There’s a chance your boy will not take this into consideration when it comes to breath. It’s always helpful to pack some gum or mints before meeting up with your new kissing mate. If needed, you can have one and even offer one to the boy you intend on kissing.

, Nothing says you’re interested like a little flirtation. If you’re confident, interesting, look the part and have created a welcoming moment, flirting can even open the possibility of your boy going for the kiss himself.


Smile. Nothing creates a friendly persona like a smile. A smile indicates you’re happy and interested to be talking. Boys need all the positive reinforcement they can get, so a smile can go a long way. A smile will also subtly draw his attention to your mouth, something he’ll hopefully become intimate with! Make light contact. Subtly touching your boy will drop an even larger hint that you’re interested. Lightly touch his arm, shoulder, hand, or chest during conversation or even lightly, “accidentally” bump into him while walking. Even minimal contact will draw his attention and let him know you’re flirting. Plus, when you’re ready to move in for the kiss, the touching “barrier” between the two of you will already be broken.
Pay him compliments. Guys, like girls, need all the positive reinforcement they can get. Complimenting features you find attractive or beautiful, be it his hair, personality, sense of humor, eyes, muscles, or intelligence, can go a long way in letting him know you want to take things to the next level. , Ask your boy out on a date or a group date. If you don’t think he’ll go for that, meet up with him while he’s with his friends or while you’re with your friends. You can also suggest meeting up at a party. In any case, it’s important to eliminate as many spectators as possible to create a more intimate, “kiss worthy” moment.


Make it easy for him to get you alone. Try not to include your friends if you’re meeting up. Guys are often leery about making contact with a girl when her friends surround her, as they often do not share the same opinion about a particular boy. Remember, guys need as much positive reinforcement as possible. Girls can often serve as static to this situation, one you’d prefer to be crystal clear.
Suggest the two of you go for a walk together. There’s nothing like spending some time outside, be it outside of a party or just enjoying the day. A walk provides the perfect opportunity to create a kissing environment and utilize your flirting abilities.
Offer to help with tedious chores or errands. If your boy is buying groceries, grabbing a cup of coffee, cleaning or paying bills, offer to be his copilot. This situation will not only demonstrate interest, but offer a perfect chance to be alone.

, Make sure your body language is open, welcoming and reinforcing. How you carry yourself will send either the right or wrong signals to your kissing mate. Make sure your shoulders are facing him if sitting next to him, that you’re visibly interested in what he’s talking about (smiling and nodding are good for this), and that you’re maintaining light contact.Avoid crossing your arms, tightly crossing your legs, twiddling your thumbs, or constantly clasping your hands together. These indicate you could be bored with the conversation, anxious to leave, or that you’re generally not enjoying yourself. This is the last thing you want to do when you’re trying to kiss a boy. Don’t be afraid to show how nervous you are. A healthy bit of nervousness can show your boy how excited you are to be around him. The most obvious signs can act as positive reinforcement and physically articulate how much you like him and are enjoying yourself.

, Do not force the situation, especially if you’re not sure if your boy is ready to be kissed. When the time is right, chances are he’ll be doing the exact same things you are to ensure a kiss will happen.


Be prepared to create more opportunities to be alone. Your first get-together with your potential kissing mate may not go as planned. Do not be discouraged – your boy may need more obvious hints or efforts to fully comprehend what’s going on. Remember to stay confident and patient.

, It’s important that you lock eyes with your intended kissing mate. Not only does eye contact create an intimate moment, it can also drop the hint that you’re ready to do more than talk.


Locking eyes can create that particular romantic moment you’re looking for with your boy. Such a moment can break the barrier and change a meet up from casual to ideal for kissing. , Find a reason or excuse to be close to your boy. If you’re out walking, say you’re cold. If you’re sitting somewhere, use the same excuse! When you’re sure the moment is right, find any excuse to be close to your boy’s lips.


Being close to your boy can serve as an indication of how interested or ready to kiss he is. Be prepared to maintain your patience if you don’t get the reaction you desire. He may need a bit more time.

, If you’re unsure whether or not your boy is ready to fully smooch, break the kiss barrier with a kiss on the cheek. The way your boy reacts may indicate whether or not he’s ready to kiss you, be it later on in the night or the next time you see him.


Make sure he knows it’s not just a friendly kiss. Instead of simply pecking him on the cheek, linger a bit during the kiss. Make sure your lips feel soft against a good spot on his cheek. It’s important that even this kiss is memorable, so do it somewhere close to his ear or near his mouth.

, After you’re close and have maintained eye contact, your boy should get the hint that you’re ready for a full-on smooch. Make sure your lips are light and soft, welcoming him to take the lead if needed. Line up your nose with his nose and turn slightly to the right or left to avoid collision. In any case, a light kiss will be much more welcoming and enjoyable to your boy over a hard, deep kiss. A good technique to use is to lean in, and right before your lips meet his, hold off a bit. This will create a sense of longing in your boy and allow him to close the gap. This way, you’ll know for sure that the situation is mutual.
If you make your lips into a tight pucker, you may send the wrong signal. This may indicate you were not ready for a full kiss or that you’re generally not enjoying it and uncomfortable with what’s happening.

, You can put your hands to great use and indicate – and even increase – the level of enjoyment by letting your hands roam. Run your hands along the back of his head, lightly caress his neck, or even let your fingers run through his hair during the kiss.


Your hands can also pull your boy in closer to heighten the level of the kiss and make it easier to maneuver around each other’s faces.
Make sure you’re not too rough or forward when caressing his neck, back or hair, as it may send the wrong signal. Remember, you’re just at the kissing stage with your boy. Other sorts of affections will come later and when you're ready.

, After you’ve initiated the first kiss, you can also add more variety to the situation by changing the way you kiss. You can begin by lightly changing the intensity and speed in which you’re kissing. The trick is to keep the kissing interesting and enjoyable rather than long and tedious.


You can significantly up your kissing game by lightly sucking on your boys lower lip. If he likes it, chances are he’ll return the favor. This technique can heighten the experience for the both of you and make the situation that much more memorable. Remember, never make it too intense, as you don’t want to make the situation memorable in an awkward way.

, Nothing makes a kiss more memorable than transforming it to a French kiss. A French kiss is reminiscent of all those black and white Hollywood hits and has really become the standard when it comes to romance.


To French kiss, you open your mouth slightly – only enough to ease your tongue through – before lightly touching his lips with it. Don’t let your tongue linger for too long.
If your boy returns the gesture, he’s ready to French kiss. The rest of the kiss involves turning your head slightly to the side to avoid nose and teeth collision.
Move your tongue into his mouth and lightly caress his tongue with yours. Chances are, he’ll be doing the same thing. Remember to keep your tongue moving, otherwise it will simply be resting inside his mouth!
Be sure to change the pace and intensity while French kissing. Like a normal kiss, the moment can quickly move from passionate and romantic to boring and tedious if kept too routine.

, Make sure you leave your boy wanting more. If you’ve utilized your hands, tried a few kissing techniques, and let the kiss linger, chances are it was a fun and enjoyable experience. If your boy enjoyed it, he’ll want to do it again and soon. Let him wonder when the next encounter will be!

,
Finished.

",How to Get Your Crush to Be the Conversation Starter," Either strike up the courage to ask him yourself, or get the information from someone else.


Make sure you are aware if he is single or not.






You may want to get someone else to ask him for you, or ask one of his friends that you trust and are comfortable with. Make sure it's not obvious that you're interested in him, or there may be trouble!
If you find out that he already has a girlfriend, immediately back off. If his girlfriend suspects that you are trying to win him over, or she believes that he is cheating on her, there could be plenty of trouble, and you wouldn't want to get mixed up in that!

Your crush could also misunderstand your intentions, and think less of you.




Scope out where he usually sits, and who he usually sits with.






Familiarize yourself with his likes and dislikes.






Know his taste, and what types of girls he is interested in.





;
, When you pass by him in the hallways, smile softly, and greet him with a simple, ""Hey."" If he smiles and greets you back, that's a good sign. If he ignores you, keep trying for a little bit, then stop if it's obvious he isn't interested in you.


Not only does this step ensure that your crush is aware of your existence, but it will also begin your relationship with him!






Make sure you don't overuse this step, as it will get a little creepy!






When you smile, don't smile widely, or you'll appear a little freakish. A soft, small but noticeable smile will make you look pretty, and he'll think of you as an approachable, friendly person.







, On all of your social networks and websites, label yourself as ""single"". Include casually that you're single in all of your profile pages. Go even further, and - if possible - wear a single bracelet!

, You don't have to completely change it just for him, but try playing around with hairstyles and clothing till you find a good balance between what you feel comfortable in and what he likes to see girls wear.


For example: If your crush likes sporty girls and/or sports, wear a baseball cap or shirt (his favorite team, if possible).






Try to connect your style with his likes so that you form a link!


If he notices your clothing, and either compliments and/or asks you about it (ex: ""Are you a Steelers' fan?""), play it cool, and act like it was a coincidence that you wore what he liked. However, try not to lie or make a habit of it.







, You don't need to go overboard, and stock up on all the perfumes and take a shower every hour that passes, but be clean and show him that you take good care of your body. Follow the steps below for good hygiene:


Take a shower every single day, using lukewarm water and an effective, nice-smelling soap. Spend no more than six minutes each time you take a shower, and make sure you scrub, not soak.






For soft skin, moisturize your entire body exactly fifteen minutes after you take your shower. This will enhance your skin very well!


Wash your hair no more than three times a week with an effective shampoo and conditioner, making sure they contain the proper, natural ingredients your hair type requires. Washing your hair too frequently can cause it to become oily, stinky, and dried up. No guy likes gross hair! Beware of washing your hair too few times as well.






If it appears that your shampoo and conditioner aren't working as well on your hair as you would like them to, try switching to a different brand or type that suits your hair type well.


Brush your teeth in the morning and at night with an effective toothpaste. Use mouthwash in the morning before you leave for school, and make sure you floss every day at night.






If you wear braces, make sure to take extra good care of your teeth!


Use a body and hand lotion that uses natural ingredients with no harmful chemicals in it. This will help make your skin smoother and softer, tempting your crush to want to feel how nice it is (he may or may not, depending on his personality and confidence).






Cleanse your face with a good cleanser twice a day - morning and night. Make sure your cleanser isn't too strong, or you'll experience more frequent outbreaks of nasty pimples. Rinse well with lukewarm water. Follow with toner and moisturizer.






Don't deprive your pimples of moisturizer, as they actually need plenty of moisture in order to heal effectively and quickly. However, be careful not to use too much moisturizer on them!



, You can either casually ask him ahead of time what classes he is planning to take, get a friend to ask him for you, or ask one of your crush's friends that you trust and are comfortable with.


Again, make sure it isn't obvious that you're interested in your crush, or word could get out and you'll be embarrassed!






Make sure you don't appear in every single class of your crush's. As tempting as the idea is, it'll freak him out and/or he'll become suspicious and perhaps withdrawn from you. Appear in at least three or more so that he'll notice you enough.







, If he is the confident type, he'll enjoy talking about himself. Make sure to put in some information about yourself as well, but limit it so that you sound a little mysterious, leaving him wanting to know more about you.


Don't blab out every bit of information about you, but give out just enough so that he has a basic knowledge of your personality and life.






Let him do most of the talking, unless if he seems uncomfortable with it. If your crush is the shy type, you may have to do most of the steering in the conversation, and try not to intimidate him. Be gentle, and talk softly enough so that he is comfortable with the volume of your voice.






Don't wait for your crush to start the conversation. At this point, you may have to start most of the conversations till you become a part of his daily life, and he'll begin to start the conversations when he recognizes you as that.






If you keep silent, and wait for your crush to come up to you and start the conversation, the chances of that happening is extremely low, unless if he is very interested in you and possibly curious enough to try to find out about you.
It's okay to be shy, but there is a limit to how shy you can get. Break out of your shell, or you'll never be able to make any progress in your relationship with your crush! Build your confidence, and tell yourself you can do it. If he is the right guy for you, you'll win him over. If he isn't, don't let him get to you, and simply move on with life.



, Make random appearances here and there. If your crush or your crush's friend(s) question you, be ready with plausible excuses such as: ""The other tables were full"" or ""My friend was sitting here, so I came to sit here too"". Bring a trustworthy friend along to sit with you so that it doesn't seem awkward.


If your crush sits at an all-guys table, it's probably best to keep to your own tables. Sit near enough so that he notices you, but not in your crush's table if this happens to be the case.






Don't sit alone, or he'll think you're a loner and not be interested.


Keep in mind that once you become good enough friends with your crush, your friendship with him can be the key to unlock the borders blocking you from his all-guys table. Just make sure to bring a friend along if you're uncomfortable about sitting with all-guys. Plus, it could look suspicious to the students if you're the only girl at your crush's table.






Your crush may unexpectedly walk up to you, and invite you to sit with his table even if you two aren't close enough friends yet. Although this may be unlikely, it could happen, but don't wait for it to happen! Make it happen.

Look at how the popular kid acts around your crush.,
Think of some qualities that you have that the popular kid doesn't have.,
Try being a little bit like the popular kid.,
Befriend them.,
Spend time with your crush.,
Text your crush.,
When you're ready, ask them out.",How to Get Your Crush to Choose You over a Popular Kid," Do they seem to like your crush? Have you caught them looking at your crush often (even briefly)? How often have you seen the popular guy or girl talking to your crush? If they seem to like your crush, then you will have to work even harder, especially if your crush seems to be liking the popular kid back.;
, Are you shy but they're outgoing? You may see shyness as a disability, but shyness can have a cuteness to it that an outgoing personality just doesn't have. Embrace and bring out the cuter part of your shyness by blushing and doing other cute things that shy girls/boys usually do naturally. If it's vice versa, then be bold, strike up conversation and don't be afraid to lightly tease the guy/girl you like. Are you usually rebellious but the popular kid is usually more mild? Let the rebel in you show as rebel girls/guys can be hot and fun. Show them your wild side (appropriately mind you) by not being afraid to dance and have fun at parties and ignoring the popular kids if they try to insult you or, even better, coming up with a sassy, clever comeback to say to them. If it's vice versa, then try to show him the sweetness of a mild, more simple personality by doing nice little things for him like being there for him when he's upset and befriending him. Basically, use whatever qualities you have against the popular kid in your flirting.

, This basically means trying to incorporate their personality into your personality. If you're a rebel and the other person is mild, try toning down your wild side and being a little less intimidating and reckless and looking before you leap. However, don't kill the rebel in you either and remember the last step! If the other person is more of a rebel than you, then try being a little more rebellious yourself by being less afraid of risking embarrassed and being able to laugh embarrassment off, taking a few risks (as long as they don't endanger your life and aren't too extreme), and standing up for yourself and others boldly. Just remember to still be mild and simple, yet interesting. If you're a shy guy/girl, try being a little more outgoing and making some small talk with your crush, even if it is sprinkled with shyness. You could also flirt a bit more boldly by catching their eye and winking, but then blushing and turning away shyly or teasing them lightly but then acting a little embarrassed and laughing a little to add some of your shy style to your flirting technique. If you're more of the outgoing, bold type, be a little bit shy as well. If you're an outgoing girl, try shyly playing with your hair, giggling, or biting your lip. If you're an outgoing guy, try looking away from them a little more quickly if they look at you and even laughing nervously sometimes. Just make sure that you still talk to your dream guy/girl often and stay bold.

, Most of the time popular girls won't befriend their crushes (they'll just flirt) however, popular guys will usually befriend them so this method might not work as well for the guys. However, it can't hurt to be a friend to your crush either way. This can help your crush to feel closer to you and less intimidated by your attempts at flirting and/or breaking the touch barrier. This can also possibly make them more open to hugs and such.

, This can usually be a point where you have an advantage over a popular kid because since they are so popular and they have a lot of attention, they don't have much time to just hang out with their love interest and are busy with other people as well. This doesn't call for being clingy and never leaving your crush alone, but it does call for being there for your crush when they need it and just spending time getting to know your crush. He/she will really appreciate it and it may make them think all the more about you. If you're worried that your crush will be uneasy with spending time with you, become their friend (see last step) or just ""happen"" to end up sitting with them in class or at lunch.

, Don't do it non-stop or you'll appear creepy and it'll seem like you're stalking them. Just a simple ""hey. How's it going?"" and a smiley face will do.

, Just say something like, ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" Then say, ""I was wondering if we could go out sometime."" If they don't answer, say something like, ""You can get back to me on it if you'd like, okay?"" If they decline the offer, say ""That's fine. Let's just keep being friends then, if that's alright."" Stay calm and cool and don't stay as casual as possibly.

You could also try asking them for help with a task, even if you don't need assistance. As long as it's believable, it should work as long as you don't do this too frequently.

, Dip a double-sided kitchen sponge into a bucket of warm water. Gently wring it out and lather it up with saddle soap.


Be sure the sponge is damp enough to create your lather, but not dripping wet. Excess water may cause the leather to dry slowly and could lead to warping or distortion.
You can also use a loofah glove to apply and lather the saddle soap. Loofah gloves make cleaning stirrups and reins easier.

Keep your saddle out of direct sunlight while it drys, and do not apply any direct heat such as a blow dryer.
Let your saddle dry most of the way before conditioning, but try to condition before it is completely dry. You do not want your saddle to feel moist when you condition, but it should still be cool to the touch.

, Use a soft towel to apply a light layer of conditioner or oil over the entirety of the saddle. Allow the conditioner to absorb into the saddle for one hour.Use a purpose-made leather conditioning cream or neatsfoot oil to condition the saddle. Avoid products that are petroleum-based, as they could dry out the leather.
Re-apply oil or cream to your towel as necessary to ensure even coverage. Uneven coverage may cause discoloration.

, If your saddle has any rawhide elements, condition them separately. Use a conditioning cream meant especially for rawhide.

Make your own saddle soap.",How to Use Saddle Soap1," Saddle soap can be used to clean horse tack and other leather products such as shoes and boots. However, saddle soap should not be used on every leather-based product.


There are a variety of different types of leather used in products. Different types require different cleaners and the only way to know whether saddle soap is okay is to consult the manufacturer's directions.If you don't have the directions handy, you can google the product name and find information online about cleaning and care. If you see any warnings about saddle soap, it might be better to go with a different cleaner.;
, Lye is a highly caustic compound found in many commercial brands of saddle soap. If lye is listed as a primary ingredient on the brand of saddle soap you've selected, you might want to ditch that product and look for an alternative brand.


Lye's caustic nature mean it's particularly hard on leather products. It absorbs moisture quickly, which can dry out leather causing it to crack, split, and otherwise deteriorate faster.Saddle soap made with lye also has a high pH level, which causes leather to harden and darken. It can be difficult to get lye-heavy saddle soap out of cracks and crevices if you're cleaning tack, resulting in a crusty white residue.Opt for making your own saddle soap or try to buy homemade saddle soap from a local farmer's market. While such products do use lye, they tend to use it in reasonable amounts that will cause minimal damage to leather., You can make inexpensive saddle soap in your own kitchen. This might be a better option than buying commercial saddle soap, as the products used can be harmful to leather.


Use protective gloves throughout the cooking process. You'll be handling lye, which is a pretty heavy-duty material. You want to make sure you avoid burning your skin. Use an apron to cook, as lye should not come into contact with clothes you wear regularly.Get your ingredients. You'll need two pots, made of stainless steel or heat-resistant glass, a stainless steel spoon, and some kind of jars or boxes to store the concoction. You will also need beeswax, pure flake lye, castile soap shavings, water, and pure gum turpentine. These products can be purchased at grocery stores, hardware stores, and health food stores.In one pot, combine 6.25 parts beeswax, 10 parts pure flake lye, and 10 parts water. Boil the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.Get the second pot. Melt together 2 parts castile shavings and 10 parts water. Once the soap liquifies, add it to the first mixture.Move the pot away from heat and add 15 parts turpentine. Pour the mixture into containers, cover, and store the saddle soap in a cool and dry part of your home. The soap does not have a shelf life, so you can wait as long as you want to use it.When you finish, clean your kitchen thoroughly. Keep your protective gloves on during this time. Lye can be harmful if ingested, so you want to make sure your kitchen is clear of lye before you begin cooking and eating again."

, Whenever you're near a horse, always move in calm, easy motions. Move your hands up slowly to take the rope, then coil it loosely in one hand.

, Reach up to the horse's face and hold the halter at the bottom of the noseband, near the middle ring. Confirm that the halter is securely fastened.


Never hook your finger through the halter, or the rings. If the horse pulls away abruptly, you could injure your hand.
If the horse is not wearing a halter, skip down to the section below.

, Let go of the halter and take up most of the slack in the rope, so the horse knows you've attached it. Avoid pulling hard or holding the rope too close to the horse, as this may cause an inexperienced horse to panic. A very skittish horse may even rear if you pull down or forward on the rope.


A trained horse should yield to pressure on the lead rope, and move forward.
A green horse may pull back. If the horse pulls back or backs up, follow it. Don’t get into a tug-of-war. The horse will win.

Use a curry comb to detangle dirt, mud, and any other debris that might be matted in your horse's hair. Do not use the curry comb over any bony parts of the horse's body, as these may be more sensitive and could be injured by aggressive combing. Do not curry comb the neck and face. Use a stiff-bristled body brush, also called the dandy brush, to continue dislodging hard-to-remove debris and remove the debris you've already dislodged. You can use this brush on the neck, chest, and legs. Use a soft brush to gently flick away the debris removed by the curry comb and the body brush. Use this brush to do the face and legs.Finish things off by gently wiping down your horse's face and body with a clean grooming cloth.;
, Inspect the saddle and pad for any foreign objects that could cause irritation to your horse., It's important to position the saddle pad properly, as this will be the barrier between your saddle and the horse's skin.


Put the saddle pad on the withers (shoulders), slightly forward of where you want it to end up. The saddling process will inevitably drag the saddle pad back, so starting slightly forward should allow the saddle and pad to end up where you want them. Never slide the saddle pad forward on your horse's back for you will cause the hair to go against the grain and make it uncomfortable for the horse., Lift the saddle in such a way that none of these attachments will get caught under the saddle., If you have a hard time lifting the saddle, you may need to request assistance during this step.


Stand next to your horse's left shoulder.
Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your left foot near the horse's left hoof and your right foot slightly behind your left.Swing your torso and hoist the saddle up, so that your right arm ends up draped across the horse's back. This should land the saddle right on the saddle pad, on your horse's back., Allow them to hang down across your horse.

, Snug the front cinch (also called a girth). This should be done on your horse's left side, and should snug your saddle into place., It's important to keep the back cinch tight, as this will keep the saddle from lifting up during riding. (Some saddles do not have a back cinch. Despite what the picture depicts, please assure that the girth is hooked on before you start with the other cinches), There are a number of different types of breast plate, and each one will require different assembly instructions.


Ensure that the breast collar's center cinch strip is aligned with the center of your horse's stomach.
Thread the latigo from the left side through the ring on the end of the cinch and D ring twice.
Pull tightly, then thread the latigo around the back of the D ring to the left, around front then back through. The end should then come through the middle of the D ring, and thread down behind the loop made (like tying a tie), pulling tightly again.

, One way of doing this is by gently bending your horse's front two legs at the knees, stretching out the belly and freeing any flesh that may have been caught in the cinches., Be sure that your saddle is properly attached before you untie your horse.

, Most horses are accustomed to being mounted from the left, and may become frightened if you attempt to mount from the right. Before mounting, ALWAYS check the tightness of the cinch (or girth)."

, Approach the horse from the front, making sure it can see you. Stand on the left side of the head, since this is where the halter will buckle. Face the same direction as the horse.

, Place the loose lead rope high up on the horse's neck, just behind the draw. Pull the other end down under the neck so you can hold the loop closed in your right fist. This will keep the horse in place.

, Hold the halter by the side ring on the noseband closer to you. Open the top halter buckle.

, Let go of the lead rope, and use that hand to reach under the jaw and put the back of the halter over the neck, behind the ears. Buckle the halter snug, but not tight. The end of the lead rope should still be over the horse’s neck. Reward the horse with a pat or a nice scratch, so it associates haltering with a reward.


To keep the lead rope from falling down, you may place it over your arm. Never loop it around your neck, or around your arm, or the horse could injure you when it moves.
If the horse is tall, you may need to flip the halter up above the neck.

, Check that the halter is secure and comfortable. There should be at least two fingers of space between the noseband and the horse.

, If the horse is not used to ropes, let the animal sniff and investigate it first. It may help to rub the rope against your body, demonstrating that it is not harmful. Let the horse chew on the rope, and rub it gently against its nose. Praise the horse when it relaxes.


If the horse doesn't calm down, raise your arms and calmly shoo it away. Once the horse calms down and starts chewing or dips its head, turn your body and invite it to approach. Repeat the exercise with the rope until the horse calms down.

, If the horse presses its ears back or tries to back away, calmly stroke the horse and speak in gentle tones. Be gentle and patient until the horse relaxes and lets you put on the halter or clip on the rope. Always convince the horse to cooperate instead of forcing the halter on; you're never going to win a contest of strength with a horse.

, If the horse is not fully relaxed after you've clipped on the rope, unhook it again and let the horse move away. Call it back to you, quickly snap the rope on again, and praise the horse if it stays calm. Repeat until the horse accepts the rope without pulling away.


Do not chase after the horse in this situation. It's easier to develop trust if the horse comes to you.

, If the horse will still not relax during this process, try attaching a very short rope instead, that the horse can't step on while grazing. Let the horse walk away with this short rope attached, then once they've calmed down, remove the rope and let the horse walk off. Repeat until the horse is no longer scared of ropes.

Learn the best knots for tying up a horse ahead of time.,
Learn to tie a quick-release knot.,
Learn another quick-release knot.,
Learn to tie a bowline knot.,
Use caution when tying knots.",How to Tie up a Horse1," The most common knots used to tie a horse are quick-release knots, of which there are several varieties, and the bowline knot. Quick-release knots are easy to tie, and while they will tighten up if the horse pulls against the rope, are still easy to release with a quick tug of the trailing rope.
The bowline is a bit less convenient to tie and untie, but will not tighten up if the horse pulls on it. Also, some horses are quite adept at untying quick release knots. If you are going to leave your tied horse unsupervised or know that he has untied a quick release in the past, the bowline is the safer option. Practice tying these knots ahead of time, before you use them with an actual horse.;
, This quick-release knot should not tighten if your horse pulls against it, and is very easy to untie.


First make a fold in the rope (called a ‘’bight’’) and fold it over the pole you are tying to, or through a ring.
Then make another bight in the part of the rope that leads to the horse (called the “standing end”).
Pull the second bight through the first bight.
Then with your other hand, make a bight in the loose end of the rope, and pull this through the second bight.
To tighten the knot, pull on the standing end.
To release the knot, simply tug on the loose end.

, This quick-release knot is easy to tie and untie, and can be finished off in a daisy-chain fashion to take up extra rope, and prevent your horse pulling or tripping on the loose end. First loop the rope over a pole, or through a ring.
Then twist the loose end of the rope to form a loop.
Hold the loop in your left hand, and with your right hand, wrap the loose end over the standing end.
Fold the loose end over into a bight, and pull the bight through the loop in your left hand.
Pull on the standing end to tighten the knot.
Pull on the loose end to release the rope.
To create an extra-secure knot that is harder for your horse to untie, create another bight in the loose end of the rope, and feed it through the last loop. Repeat this daisy-chain process as many times as needed to use up the loose end of the rope.

, This is a secure knot that will not tighten if the horse pulls on it. You can untie it quickly, but your horse cannot.


First take the standing end of the rope in your left hand and wrap the loose end over the pole.
Then twist a loop in the standing end, and feed the loose end through the loop.
Then wrap the loose end back over the standing end, and through the loop again going the other way.
Pull firmly on both the loose and standing ends to snug the knot., Never wrap a rope around your hand or finger, or put your hand inside or through any loop or bight while tying up a horse. If the horse were to jerk quickly, the loop could tighten on your hand and cause serious injury. Be careful to avoid doing this while you practice tying knots to avoid learning unsafe knot-tying habits.

Keep a knife handy for cutting rope in emergency situations.,
Use caution around tied horses.,
Untie the horse before removing its halter.",How to Tie up a Horse2," You should only tie a horse up with a rope connected to a well-fitting halter. Tying a horse up by the bridle, either directly to the bit or to the reigns, can cause the horse pain and serious injury., Only tie your horse to a solid object that the horse cannot break or pull over. Horses are very strong and can pull with tremendous strength when frightened. If you tie your horse to a fence or railing, inspect the poles or rails and be sure to choose one that is not damaged or corroded. Make sure the area in the immediate vicinity of the horse is clear of dangerous objects the horse might step on or run into.If you must tie your horse to something the horse ‘’could’’ break, tie a loop of string around the object and then tie the horse’s rope to the string, instead of the object itself. If the horse does decide to make a break for it, this will minimize property damage.

, Make sure to tie your horse up far enough away from other horses that they cannot fight. It is best not to tie your horse up around other horses at all, until it is used to being tied., Do not tie the horse to an object on or near the ground. The horse could step on the rope, trip on it, or get tangled up on it, and potentially suffer serious injury. You can tie a horse to something higher than his head., Leave about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) of rope between the horse and the object it is tied to. This is enough rope to allow the horse to comfortably move his head. Leaving more rope can lead to injury., If your horse will be tied up for a number of hours, be sure that there is food and water available, and that the horse is sheltered from the elements. Tying your horse to a sturdy fence post under the shade of a tree might be an option, or to a sturdy post or gate inside a barn.Check on the horse frequently, especially if it is new to being tied up.

, It is always a good idea to carry a knife, in case the horse manages to pull the knot tight and you need to release it in a hurry. Cut through the rope between the post or ring and the knot. Be sure to hold the knife so the blade is facing away from both you and your horse, so that no one is injured if the rope abruptly gives way., Never step over or under a tie rope, and remain well out of kicking range when walking behind the horse. Speak to your horse softly before approaching it, to avoid startling it, and keep your hands on the horse as you walk alongside it., Untie the horse and turn the horse to where you want it to go before you remove the halter. Quick-release knots should be very easy to untie. For the bowline, simply untie the knot using both hands."

You should be able to put a finger or two between the harness and the guinea pig. If it's too tight, it could harm the guinea pig's back over time and chaff under his armpits.It may not be a good idea to put a harness on at all. Some owners have had trouble with harnesses harming guinea pigs' backs after they've worn it several times.;
, If you insist on using a leash, make sure you just do it in the yard. That is, you can use a leash to keep your guinea pig from wandering too far. However, you need to supervise the guinea pig the whole time. A leash isn't license to leave your guinea pig alone outside.Also, don't tug on the leash. Just let your guinea pig roam about.
Make sure the leash is always loose, and your guinea pig doesn't get tangled in it.

, While you can put your guinea pig in a harness, it's not a good idea to walk it on a leash. The tugging sensation can harm the guinea pig's delicate spine very easily. In addition, most guinea pigs won't take to walking, meaning they can't be trained to walk beside you on a leash.In addition, guinea pigs can easily slip out of harnesses, so they can escape before you can catch them.
Therefore, trying to walk a guinea pig in a street isn't a good idea. It could get away from you and be harmed.

In addition, guinea pigs can get lost in the shuffle or be scared by loud noises.Consider picking a single room that doesn't have too many places for the guinea pig to hide.
A hallway or bathroom works well. Places like the kitchen have too many places for the guinea pigs to hide or squeeze into.
Also remember that guinea pigs like to chew. If you love the furniture in a particular room, you may not want to put your guinea pigs in there.
Another option is to use a wire pen or cage that you set up in a room.

, Guinea pigs are happy to chew on electrical cords if you give them the chance. Make sure any cords are up out of reach of the guinea pigs or that you pick a room that doesn't have them near the floor., Move any plants and other hazards out of reach. Plastic bags, for instance, can pose a suffocation hazard. Make sure to also pick up any dead leaves, as many houseplants are poisonous to guinea pigs., If you have larger animals in your home, they should not be in the same room as the guinea pigs when they are out. They could attack or injure the guinea pigs by just following their instincts., That way, they won't rush into the room without checking to see where the guinea pigs are. In addition, if guinea pigs are underfoot without the family's knowledge, they could easily be stepped on.You could use a note or sign on the door to help family members remember.
This step also warns your family not to let other pets in.

, Try to provide at least 3 hours outside of the cage a day if the guinea pigs are in a cage that isn't large enough for them.That means that if your guinea pig has less than 7.5 square feet, you need to provide this time out of the cage every day. Otherwise, your guinea pig could get bored.

, If you let your guinea pigs out of their cage for extended periods, don't forget they still need food and water. If they can't go back to their cage, make sure you have food and water out for them."

For one, you should always provide them with shade, so they can cool down. In addition, only let them out during cooler times of the day in the summer.Guinea pigs prefer temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. While they can stand a bit more variation, you don't want to go too much colder or warmer., Damp grass can give your pig a chill, and that's not good for them. Also, make sure you aren't setting them down on grass that has been sprayed with insecticides or other chemicals, as that can be damaging for your guinea pig., Once again, you want to be sure to always provide your guinea pig with food and water. Water is especially important when your guinea pig is outside because it can easily get dehydrated when it is warm out., Guinea pigs love to chew on any plant in their vicinity, which is fine when they're munching on grass. However, some plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, so you want to make sure they don't have access to those.Use a database like Cornell's http://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/index.html to look up poisonous plants in your area. Many common plants like daisies and buttercups are poisonous to guinea pigs.
If you keep your guinea pigs just on grass without weeds, you should be fine.

, You do not want to leave your guinea pig unattended outside. For one, if your enclosure doesn't have a roof, your guinea pig could easily be carried off by a predator. It could even happen if your enclosure does have a roof.In addition, you want to make sure your guinea pigs don't wriggle out and escape.
Also, because guinea pigs are susceptible to heat stroke, you want to keep an eye on them while outside. Signs of heatstroke include lethargy, a limp body, trouble breathing, a rapid pulse, and a wet chin. Your guinea pig may also feel hot to the touch. Check the ears to see if they feel extra warm.
If you notice signs of heatstroke, bring the guinea pig indoors. Use tepid water (not cold because it can cause shock) to dab around the ears and feet. You can even dip its feet in water. Once the guinea pig seems cooler, take it to the vet."

Build your own.",How to Walk a Guinea Pig on a Leash4," A large cage is important because it gives your guinea pig a large area to explore. The larger the cage is, the better off your guinea pig will be. At a minimum, each guinea pig should have 7.5 square feet of cage.That's a cage that's approximately 3 by 2.5 feet.
If you can, go for a bigger cage, so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage.

, You can buy a cage for a guinea pig. However, most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough. You can find ones meant for other animals, though, that will work for guinea pigs. Pick one that has metal bars on the side, not wood, as guinea pigs can't chew through metal.Also, make sure it has a solid floor. Guinea pigs' feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire, so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig.
Go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels. Floor space is more important.

, Another option is making your own. You can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath. One option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast, available from sign making shops.Start with cube grids. Cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward ""cage.""
Cut the correx or coroplast to fit. You can use the material as a floor, then use more of it to create a border around the floor. Tape it together from the outside. Add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage.

You can also practice getting her to come to you when called by taking her out of her cage and placing her a few feet away from you. Call her by name and hold out one of her favorite treats.
Your guinea pig should be motivated to run to you. When she does so, give her a treat as a reward. Practice this at least once a day and over time she should come to you when called by name outside her cage and inside her cage.;
, This is another simple command you can teach your guinea pig using a treat.


Hold a treat above your guinea pig’s head so she has to stand on her back legs to get to it. Say the command “Stand up” and then let her have the treat once she is on her back legs.
Repeat this command once a day on a consistent basis. Over time, your guinea pig will stand up when you command her, even when you are not holding a treat.

, You can practice this command with your guinea pig when she is in her cage or outside of her cage.


Hold a treat in your hand and let your guinea pig approach you. When she is in front of you, move your hand so you make a circle, and say the command “Circle”.
Your guinea pig should follow the motion of your hand, with the treat, and make a circle. Once she makes a circle, give her the treat. Repeat this once a day until she can circle on command, without the treat.

, Use a ball that is not too heavy and not too big, like a tennis ball, so your guinea pig can maneuver it easily. You will also need a treat that is long and flat, like a carrot stick.


Place the carrot stick on the ground and then put the tennis ball on top of the carrot stick.
Encourage your guinea pig to try to push the ball off the treat so she can access the treat and say “Push the ball.”
Repeat these steps and over time you should be able to remove the treat so she learns to push the ball on her own, without the treat.

, You will need a hoop that is about 6” - 10” in diameter, or you can use pipe cleaners to form a hoop that is close to that size. The top of an ice cream tub, or a tennis racket without the strings would also work. Make sure that whatever you use as a hoop, there are no sharp edges or anything your guinea pig can get stuck on as she learns to jump.Begin by holding the hoop so it touches the ground or the bottom of your guinea pig’s cage. Hold a treat on one side of the hoop, or have someone help you by holding the treat as you hold the hoop.
Call your guinea pig’s name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop. Say the command: “Through the hoop”. You may need to give your guinea pig a nudge or a gentle push to convince her to jump through the hoop. Over time, she will be motivated enough by the treat to jump through the hoop and get it.
Praise her and give her the treat when she goes through the hoop. Repeat these steps until your guinea pig starts to go through the hoop on her own, without the motivation of the treat.

, Many guinea pig owners teach their pets to go to the bathroom in a litter box. However, this takes a lot of patience and practice. When you are first litter box training your guinea pig, be prepared for some accidents and do not scold or punish your guinea pig if this happens. Your guinea pig will respond more to positive reinforcement and acknowledgement.To litter train your guinea pig, place a litter box in the spot in her cage where she goes to the bathroom often. Place a handful of hay in the box and a few fecal pellets.

Although there is one corner where she will go most often, this does not mean she will always go in this corner. Just pick the place she frequents the most.;

Pick one that is the right size for the cage as well as one that will be comfortable for your guinea pig. You don't want it to be too small because then she won't have enough room to sit and go to the potty.


You can buy small litter trays at your local pet store that are for small rodents.
You also need to put in brand new bedding. Otherwise, she will smell her old pee and might want to go there., The litter tray needs to be filled with the same kind of bedding that you keep in your guinea pig cage. Although it is called a litter tray, the substance used for the tray is not what is typically considered litter but is actually just the same hay or straw that you keep in your guinea pig cage. You should take a handful or two from the cage where she has already pooped and peed and lay that in the litter tray at first. Then you should set the try in the cage that you picked earlier.


Using hay at first that has already been soiled will lead her to the tray because her scent will be all over it.
The kinds of bedding that work great for guinea pigs are aspen, wood pulp, hay, and straw. There are also different varieties of litter pellets and bedding that have been vet recommended as well. Never buy cedar or corn cob for your guinea pig because they are toxic.
Don't put her food and water near or in the litter box. She will not like to potty where she eats.You can also put a little bit of eating straw in her litter tray as well so she will feel comfortable in there and might be able to munch a little while she goes to the bathroom., Once you place the try in her cage, watch to see if she uses it. Since it smells like her and is in a familiar location, she should use it most of the time. If you find that she doesn't use it, you might have to take it out and try again. There might be something wrong with the tray that is deterring her from using it.When you see her using her litter box, give her a treat. This will encourage her behavior and make her want to use it more so you will give her more treats.If the sides on the litter tray look too big for her, you should use sharp scissors or a small saw or knife and cut the excess edge off. This will make it short enough for her to get into the tray.

, You should only clean out the litter tray every three days or so. You can dump out what is in the litter tray and replenish it with new litter. You should only wash the tray every other week. This will make sure that her smell will remain on the tray and she will likely go back to it.You should use litter that is best for guinea pigs. If you aren't sure what to use, ask at your local pet store or vet's office.

, Although most guinea pigs will learn to use a litter tray most or all of the time, there are some guinea pigs that might never learn to use it. Keep trying to get your guinea pig to use the tray, but even if she only uses it half the time, that is that much less you have to clean up out of her cage.Never punish your guinea pig or yell at her. She doesn't understand why she needs to go to the potty in the same place all the time. Encourage the good behavior, but don't try punishment. It doesn't work on guinea pigs., Once you have trained your guinea pig in her cage, you may want to train your guinea pig outside of her cage during play time. Start somewhere small. It needs to be an area that you can control easily and where you can keep an eye on her. You should make sure there aren't any small vents that she can run into without getting out.


A bathroom or hallway is a great place to start. They are small, have few wires that are close to the ground, and have very few places for your guinea pig to hide. This will help keep her safe and help you keep track of her while still allowing her to exercise., You need to pick a dark, out of the way corner of the room to place her litter tray. This will encourage her to seek that corner out and use it to potty. Since this will be the only thing that has her smell on it, she will be able to find it, not matter which corner you put it in.


Try to leave some litter in it that has already been used. This way it will feel like her territory.
If you want, you can let her loose for a little while first to see which corner she prefers to go to the potty and then place her litter tray there., Guinea pigs like to use the potty in dark corners away from other things, just like they do in their cages. To help persuade your guinea pig to use the corner where you placed her tray, you need cover up the remaining corners so she cannot run there to potty.


If she has no other dark corner to pee or poop in, she will be more likely to use her litter tray in the other corner.
If you want to, you can also place newspaper around the room in case she has an accident. This will make it easier to clean up., Once your guinea pig gets used to the area, you can expand it a little at a time. Since she should already know where her litter tray is, she should use it even though her play area is bigger. Just make sure you keep wires off the floor and hard to reach hiding spaces covered so you don't injure or lose your guinea pig.


Just like with training in the cage, do not scold her if she uses the bathroom somewhere else. You can reward her when she goes in her litter tray, which will be a positive reminder to use the area."

Accept your guinea pig may not always use its litter box.",How to Litter Train Guinea Pigs," The first step to litter training is watching your guinea pig. Most guinea pigs have a certain area of their cage where they eliminate. If you set up a guinea pig's litter box in this space, it's more likely to use the box.Watch your guinea pig for a few days. Take note of where it tends to eliminate.
You can also pay attention when you're cleaning the cage. You may notice a lot of droppings and urine in one area of the cage.;
, You can buy a litter box online or make one yourself. Make sure the litter box is easy for your guinea pig to get in and out of. Place it in the corner of the cage where your guinea pig usually eliminates.Make sure the box you choose is large enough that the guinea pig can fit its entire body in the box.
Make sure the sides are low enough. The guinea pig should be able to climb in and out of the box with ease.

, Go for organic paper-based litters. Wood litters can sometimes cause respiratory problems. You can find guinea pig litter online or purchase some at a local pet store.If you can't find a litter box that works for you, you can always place litter in the corner of the box.

, Some guinea pigs have more than one corner where they eliminate. If this is the case, they are less likely to start using a single litter box. If your guinea pig eliminates in more than one corner, set up a box in each corner the guinea pig tends to use., For the most part, litter training is fairly hands off. Some guinea pigs will take to the litter box and others will not. When starting out, try to see if the guinea pig approaches the litter box on its own.Many guinea pigs will realize they're supposed to eliminate in the box. With luck, your guinea pig will take to its litter box right away.

, If your guinea pig is unsure of the box, place a small amount of hay in the box. The guinea pig may be enticed to enter the box by the hay. If it smells any lingering feces or urine, it may then realize its supposed to eliminate in the box.Some people advocate leaving food in the box. The guinea pig will eat and then eliminate. This method is only likely to work if you've seen your guinea pig defecate or urinate near its litter box before. Many guinea pigs will not eliminate near a food source to avoid contamination., If your guinea pig starts using its box, change the litter regularly. Try to change it about every three days. A guinea pig will not eliminate in a dirty litter box.Only wash the box every other week. You want some of the scent to remain intact so the guinea pig knows to use its litter box.

, Clumping cat litter can be dangerous for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs may eat clumping cat litter, and can choke on it. Clumping cat litter also contains chemicals meant to reduce scent, which can be toxic to a guinea pig.It may be a good idea to ask your vet about safe litters before choosing a litter for your guinea pig.

, Never scold a guinea pig for failing to use its litter box. Your guinea pig is unlikely to understand why it is being scolded. Scolding will not encourage your guinea pig to use its litter box. It will only create stress.You should also avoid other forms of punishment, especially physical punishment. You should never hit your pet.

, Not all guinea pigs take to a litter box. As guinea pigs are less domesticated than other household pets, they're difficult to train. Despite your best efforts, a guinea pig may never learn to use its litter box. Do not try to force a guinea pig to use a litter box if it seems unwilling.If your guinea pig does not tend to eliminate in a single corner, it is less likely to use its litter box.

If all else fails, just be a responsible and loving guinea pig owner!",How to Get Your Guinea Pig to Popcorn," If you recently adopted your guinea pig, you must give it time to settle into its new home. This is a long process, and can't just be done overnight. If your guinea pig is in a rowdy environment, or if you negatively interact (scream, hurting it etc.) with your guinea pig, it can be very difficult to get their trust again. Guinea pigs are easy pets to take care of, but they can also be very stubborn!
, A sick guinea pig isn't a happy guinea pig! Always take your guinea pig to the vet, even if you don't suspect it's sick. Regular vet checks are always a good idea.

Take your guinea pig to the vet immediately if your guinea pig has a hunched poster, crusty eyes, patchy hair loss or overall just looks like it's in pain. Guinea pigs hide sickness very well, that's how guinea pigs defend themselves in the wild because the predators can sense when a guinea pig is vulnerable.
Don't forget to take care of your guinea pig's hygiene.
You might need extra services like grooming, nail clipping, or other special procedures, like neutering. If this is your first vet visit, your guinea pig's veterinarian should tell you during your first visit if there needs to be extra services involved.
Never cut your guinea pig's nails on your own. Guinea pigs and other animals have a vein called a ""quick"" which if cut, can cause extreme pain and bleeding. So always have a licensed vet cut your guinea pig's nails.

, For example, if your guinea pig is in a hut, stick your finger close to the hut. A healthy guinea pig that trusts you will investigate by sniffing your finger for a couple of seconds before quickly returning to the hut., Guinea pigs don't want to be trapped in a cage all day! Remove all wires, plants, and other objects a guinea pig shouldn't have access to. Make sure the area is clean, and has plenty of fresh air flow (not cold air!). Cover the spot where your guinea is laying in with a fleece (avoid using an overly fluffy blanket) blanket or a towel. Fence the area in with a gate. Don't forget to throw in some of your guinea pig's favorite toys! Your guinea pig will be have plenty of space to exercise and play in, and it might show its appreciation by popcorning or oinking!

Don't forget to get supervise your guinea pig!

, This might sound like it won't work, but giving a guinea pig fresh food is actually another great way to get your guinea pig to popcorn! Guinea pigs are huge food fans, just like us humans. They will sometimes squeak when they hear a cabinet or a refrigerator opening! Make sure you supply your guinea pig with fresh hay everyday.

Don't overfeed your guinea pig. Obesity is a common problem, and can cause many problems for guinea pigs. A quick test to see if your guinea pig is underweight is to run your hands down its body, if you can feel its ribs easily its underweight. If you just feel fat and no ribs, your guinea pig is overweight.

, Don't feel bad if you never see your guinea pig popcorn. Guinea pigs have other ways of letting you know they love you, such as oinking and purring.

If your guinea pig is older, it is less likely to popcorn. Popcorning is mostly seen in younger guinea pigs.
There may be plenty of other reasons your guinea pig isn't popcorning, but if you are really concerned, talk to a guinea pig behavioral specialist or visit the vet.

Put a saddle blanket or pad on your horse's back.,
Position the saddle on the blanket.,
Position the stirrup, cinches, and straps on the left side of the horse.",How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth1," The saddle blanket protects the horse's body from friction from the leather saddle, and is vital for a safe ride. It also keeps the saddle clean from the horse's body which will sweat and froth with the exertion of a ride.If you don’t have a blanket, you need one to properly tack your horse.


You can get a saddle blanket at any farming supply or agriculture store. You can choose a traditional woven blanket which is folded in half for use, or you can buy a felt or cotton pad which is less likely to bunch under the saddle or catch burrs if you ride in a field.Be sure you brush the horse and ensure there are no burrs in its coat or any injuries to its skin.Position the blanket slightly over the horse's withers (the ridge between its shoulder blades). First put the blanket down a bit too far toward the neck, then pull it back toward the horse's tail until it's in the correct position. This method smooths the hair under the blanket so that it lies flat and doesn't itch or bother the animal.;
, This process might seem cumbersome and can take some practice before it becomes easy, especially if you're used to the English saddle which has less straps and other things dangling down.


Stand next to the horse's left shoulder and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. Hook the right stirrup up over the saddle horn so that it won't get caught under the saddle as you lift it, then swing the saddle up and over the horse's back so that your right arm is across the horse's back.Be sure to practice good lifting techniques to avoid injury to your back or leg muscles; saddles can weigh from 10-35 pounds and swinging it without proper posture could injure your muscles or joints.
As you put the saddle over the blanket, be sure that you grab the stirrups (the leather loops for the rider's feet), cinches, and straps (any leather hanging down) and hold them out of the way so that they don't get stuck under the saddle.The process of getting the saddle and blanket in the right place might cause them both to slide too far back; in that case, start over with the blanket first.

, This is the side you have been standing on to put the blanket and saddle on.


You can keep the left stirrup up over the saddle horn (the knob on top of the saddle for the rider to hold) for better access, but bring the tie down to the horse's side.

"

Attach the girth.,
Cinch the ties.,
Put the finishing touches on.",How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth2," Most saddles have a removable leather strap called a girth or latigo that attaches with buckles to the tie on the horse's right side (some have a girth attached to the tie, in which case you can skip this step).Buckle the girth securely to the tie that hangs down by the horse's front leg on the right side of the horse.
Walk in front of the horse back to its left side, and then reach under the horse's body and pass the girth underneath the horse's chest.

, The girth should be pulled up to the buckle on the left side of the horse's saddle, where it should be fastened much like the other side using a buckle.


Cinch it tightly but gently (don't force it to go tighter than feels snug and secure). You should wait until the horse exhales to cinch it, because if you tighten it while the horse has its lungs full of air it will be too loose when the horse exhales to be safe.Some horses intentionally take a deep breath right before you tighten the girth. When they do that they get bigger around, so when they breathe out the girth is too loose - just the way they like it! This is called bloating, and some horses do it because a girth doesn't fit them or their skin is being pinched under the girth. If your horse does this, you might want to check that the girth itself is long enough for your horse and not causing irritation or pain.You can secure the additional length of the tie by passing it through the D-ring at the top of the tie, wrapping it around the tie and pulling it through at the top (like a men's necktie). This will keep it up and out of the way of the horse's legs even if the horse runs.

, Before you mount up, be sure you didn't forget anything.


Be sure the stirrups are down on either side.
Double-check that everything is tight because if it's loose and you get on you'll slide right off!
Be sure that the bridle is on correctly.
Now mount up and ride! Don’t forget to mount from the left side."

Watch out for a shifting saddle.,
Notice if your saddle seems to bounce up and down.,
Dismount and inspect the cinch.,
Tighten the cinch before mounting.",How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth3," If you feel that you are having to lean to one side to keep your balance or keep upright, it's probably because the saddle was either placed on incorrectly or has shifted because it is loose. You can know for sure by looking at the pommel (the horn that you hold with one hand while riding). If the horn (or pommel, the knob that sticks up on the saddle for the rider to hold) is not in perfect alignment with the horse's mane, the saddle has shifted off-center.The saddle may have shifted because it was too loose, or it may have shifted because you are putting too much weight on one stirrup and not evenly distributing your weight (this happens all the time, especially to new riders, and especially if you're riding the horse in circles). You can try to shift the saddle back by putting your weight on the opposite side stirrup, but if the saddle moves too easily it is probably too loose.Dismount and adjust it.

, While you might do a lot of bouncing out of the saddle if your horse is trotting or cantering, the saddle itself should never leave the horse's back. If it's moving up and down as the horse moves, it will injure the horse's back.If the saddle itself seems to leave the horse's body as you trot, you must immediately dismount and tighten the girth.

, If you're not sure if the saddle is on properly, don't keep riding, even if you're worried that others will think you don't know what you're doing. Every rider has to adjust the saddle sometimes, and no one will think less of you for putting your horse's comfort and your own safety first.


If someone is with you, they can inspect the cinch for you. This is more reliable than doing it yourself since your weight in the saddle will cause more ""give"" to the girth and make it looser. Have the person check to see if they can pull the girth itself an inch or more away from the horse's body while you are in the saddle. If they can, it's too loose., You most likely will not have to repeat all the steps again, but you will need to loosen the tie and unbuckle the girth from the horse's left side to re-tighten.


Make a note of what position the buckle is in before you remove it, and then ensure that you tighten it to the next notch (or two, if the saddle was very loose) as you re-cinch it.

Build a trustworthy bond with your piggy.,
Research different training methods.,
Choose the training method that works best for you and your guinea pig.,
Gather the materials that you will need for training.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks1," Having a stable relationship with an animal makes them so much easier to train. If your guinea pig doesn't trust you, or thinks of you as a scary giant that comes to try and communicate all of the time, it will be more difficult to teach. The trust of an animal is a very fragile thing.


Think of it as if you are a mountain climber, trying to climb the mountain of training. The peak is success, and the rope that you depend on to get you to the top is the relationship with the animal you wish to train. Would you rather have a weak rope - aka a weak relationship - or a stronger, more dependable one? If you choose the weak rope, and it snaps, you'll come tumbling back down to where you started. The strong rope has a better chance of holding up, though, be aware that if you are constantly tampering with the rope, even the strongest has a chance of breaking.
If you aren't sure of your current relationship with your pet, it is best to keep working with them until they trust you enough to allow you to pick them up and pet them. This may take longer with skittish piggies, but never give up.;
, Once your piggy is willing to trust you and do what you say, it's time to start looking into the many methods of training. Guinea pigs are very fragile, and their brains work a bit differently from a dog's, so every training method will need to be tweaked before use with a guinea pig.


Clicker training and verbal markers are a few ways to train your guinea pig. Clicker training is slightly easier than using a verbal marker, and requires a clicker, while using a verbal marker is more difficult and can have different results than what is expected.

, Some owners have different needs than others, and some animals need a specific type of training. As mentioned before, any training method chosen will need to be tweaked in many different ways to suit a guinea pig rather than a dog.

, Different methods require different materials. Some may need to be purchased, while others can just be found around the house. Training a guinea pig is not as expensive as training a dog, per se, but cost is made up in effort.


If you choose to clicker train your guinea pig, you will need a soft clicker-be sure that it is not too loud or sharp for a guinea pig's ears-and, of course, treats.
Treats that have worked well for many guinea pig owners include chopped up carrots, celery (with veins removed), and lettuce torn up into little pieces. Whatever the reward may be, always make sure that it is quick, chewable, and guinea pig-safe.

Condition your guinea pig to the clicker or verbal marker.,
Once your guinea pig is well conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker, begin to slowly ease them into performing basic commands.,
Begin teaching your guinea pig.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks2," To do this, put your guinea pig in a safe area-such as its cage-and click the clicker (or say the verbal marker). A second or so after clicking the clicker, give your guinea pig a treat. Repeat this several times until you think your guinea pig understands what the click, or marker, means.


Occasionally, this will take a long time. To see if your guinea pig is properly conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker, act normal for several minutes, talking and playing with the guinea pig, and then, suddenly click the clicker or say the marker clearly and firmly. If your guinea pig looks at you, expecting a treat, they have been properly conditioned and you can move on with training. If they keep about their business, they do not yet understand what the marker means and need to be worked with on conditioning a bit more. Don't be discouraged if your guinea pig does this.

, Skittish, hyper, stubborn, or impatient guinea pigs will be more difficult to train. It takes a lot of patience to get your guinea pig to learn a trick, and often times they will respond to a hand motion rather than a word-for example, if you were teaching your guinea pig to stand up, it would be easier for them to grasp if you held your finger over their head as an indication to do the trick in contrast to just saying ""stand up!"".


Many people, before beginning to train their guinea pigs, work on targeting. Teaching targeting to a guinea pig is quite simple-to do so, hold a finger or some kind of long stick somewhere a few inches away from your guinea pig and wait. As soon as they get near the finger or stick and touch it, click or say the marker and treat. Do this about twenty or thirty times, or until your guinea pig touches it efficiently several times in a row. This may make training much easier.

, There are several different methods, and some are easier than others. Try to get your guinea pig out for at least one 5-10 minute session each day. If either you or the pig become frustrated, treat and put them back in their cage for a little while.


Keep in mind that guinea pigs' brains work differently than a cat's or dog's, so they may not process information as quickly as a larger animal. Patience is key.

"

Place your guinea pig in a piggy-proof area that both of you are comfortable in.,
Hold a treat - or, if your pig has learned targeting, a finger - above the guinea pig's head.,
Once your guinea pig stands up on its hind legs, allow it to drop back down to all fours, and then click or use the verbal marker and treat.,
Continue to do this until your guinea pig does it correctly every time.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks3," Ensure that there is nothing to pose a danger to your guinea pig, or you, and that there is nothing that your guinea pig can crawl under, save for a hidey house for them to retreat to if they feel the need.


Training inside the cage works just as well in the beginning, if your guinea pig is more comfortable in their cage. It will become harder to train inside the cage, however, as you move on to more advanced tricks that require equipment, such as climbing over things. Keep in mind that anything you do use for a trick, such as a hoop, must be adjusted to fit the needs of your piggy.
Remember that not all guinea pigs have the ability to focus on one task for more than a few minutes at a time, so changing up the training routine may help a guinea pig to learn more easily and not become bored.

, Make sure that you are not holding it impossibly high, as the idea is to make your guinea pig stand up on its hind legs to receive the treat. Don't keep it too low either, or your pig may stand up, snatch the treat, and get away with it without learning anything. This could happen with any trick.

, Praise your guinea pig as if they just did the hardest thing in the world, and then repeat.


Try to time the click or word so that the moment they drop back down, you perform the action. This will eventually lead to the mindset of your piggy being like this: Trick-->Click/Marker-->Treat-->Praise. It may take time for the guinea pig to realize this, but when they do, training is much easier.
When your guinea pig does this trick, make sure they do not stand up for too long, and allow them to lean on your hand for support if needed.

, The guinea pig may stand up on its hind legs without you giving them the motion, which is good-it shows that the guinea pig understands what it has to do to get the treat. However, it is important for them to wait for you to give the signal. If they stand up, just watch quietly, and when they finish, put the treat or finger over their head again. This part may take a while, and it may cause some confusion, but it is essential for your guinea pig to learn to wait for your command, and when they do, it's very rewarding.
