Hold a treat or targeting object above their head, encouraging them to stand on hind legs. As they drop back down, click the verbal marker and reward with treats. Repeat this process until the behavior is learned, then gradually phase out rewards for consistent performance.","Teaching a guinea pig tricks requires patience and positive reinforcement. Start by placing your furry friend in a safe area where both of you feel comfortable. Use treats or targeting techniques to encourage them to stand up on their hind legs, then reward with praise and treats when they successfully complete the trick. With repetition and consistency, your guinea pig will learn new skills in no time."
